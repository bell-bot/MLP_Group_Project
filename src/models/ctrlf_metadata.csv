0_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> because of
1_911Mothers_2010W,the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship <unk> and it is and yet it feels natural to us
2_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> first learned that my son had been in the world trade center
3_911Mothers_2010W,on the morning of september 11th two thousand and one we didn 't know if he had perished yet
4_911Mothers_2010W,until thirty six hours later <unk>
5_911Mothers_2010W,at the time
6_911Mothers_2010W,we knew that it was political we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of
7_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> my husband orlando and i
8_911Mothers_2010W,and our family and when i saw it and yet through the shock <unk> the terrible shock <unk> and the terrible
9_911Mothers_2010W,explosion in our lives <unk> literally
10_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> we were not vengeful <unk> and a couple of weeks later when zacarias moussaoui was indicted
11_911Mothers_2010W,on six counts of
12_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> conspiracy to commit terrorism <unk>
13_911Mothers_2010W,and the u s government called for a death penalty for him if convicted my husband and i spoke out
14_911Mothers_2010W,in opposition to that publicly <unk> through that and through human rights groups we were brought together
15_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> when i saw aicha in the media <unk> coming over
16_911Mothers_2010W,when her son was indicted <unk> and i thought what a brave woman someday i want to meet that woman when i 'm stronger
17_911Mothers_2010W,i was still in deep grief <unk> i knew i didn 't have the strength <unk>
18_911Mothers_2010W,i knew i would find her someday or we would find each other <unk>
19_911Mothers_2010W,because when people heard that my son
20_911Mothers_2010W,was a victim i got immediate sympathy
21_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> but when people learned what her son was accused of she didn 't get that sympathy <unk> but her suffering is equal to mine
22_911Mothers_2010W,so we met in november two thousand and two <unk> and aicha will now tell you
23_911Mothers_2010W,how that came about
24_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> organization of human rights to put me in touch
25_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> and i saw phyllis and i watched her she was the only mother in the group
26_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> and i saw in her eyes that she was a mother just like me <unk> i suffered a lot as a mother
27_911Mothers_2010W,i was married when i was fourteen <unk> i lost a child when i was fifteen
28_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> know where he is i don 't know if he 's alive i don 't know if he 's tortured i don 't know what happened to him
29_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> so that 's why i decided to tell my story so that my suffering is something positive for other women
30_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> it 's not against women it 's for us for us women for our children
31_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> i talk against violence against terrorism i go to schools to talk to young muslim
32_911Mothers_2010W,girls so they don 't accept to be married against their will very young
33_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> if i can save one of the young girls and
34_911Mothers_2010W,avoid that they get married and suffer as much as i did well this is something good <unk>
35_911Mothers_2010W,this is why i 'm here in front of you pr i would like to say that i have learned so much
36_911Mothers_2010W,from aicha starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members which was a very
37_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> private meeting with security <unk> because it was november two thousand and two <unk> and frankly we were afraid of the
38_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> that time in the country
39_911Mothers_2010W,those of us
40_911Mothers_2010W,family members
41_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> but we were all so nervous why does she want to meet us and then she was nervous why did we want to meet her
42_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> what did we want from each other <unk> before we knew each others ' names or anything we had embraced
43_911Mothers_2010W,and wept then we sat in a circle
44_911Mothers_2010W,with support with help from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation <unk> and aicha started <unk> and
45_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> i don 't know if my son is guilty or innocent but i want to tell you
46_911Mothers_2010W,how sorry i am for what happened to your families
47_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> i know what it is to suffer
48_911Mothers_2010W,and i feel that if there is a crime a person should be tried fairly and punished
49_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> and what happened then is we all told our stories <unk> and we all connected as human beings by the end of the afternoon it was about three hours
50_911Mothers_2010W,after lunch
51_911Mothers_2010W,we 'd felt as if we 'd known each other forever now what i learned from her is a woman not only who could be so generous under
52_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> these present circumstances and what it was then and what was being done to her son <unk> but the life she 's had i never had met someone
53_911Mothers_2010W,with such a hard life from such a totally different
54_911Mothers_2010W,culture and environment from my own <unk> and
55_911Mothers_2010W,i feel that we have
56_911Mothers_2010W,a special connection which i value very much and
57_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> think it 's all about being afraid of the other but making that step
58_911Mothers_2010W,and then realizing hey this wasn 't so hard <unk> who else can i meet that i don 't know or that i 'm so different from
59_911Mothers_2010W,so aicha <unk> do you have a couple of words
60_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> i wanted to say that we have to try to know other people the other
61_911Mothers_2010W,<unk> and i hope that someday we 'll all live together in peace and respecting each other this is what i wanted to say
62_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> i thought i 'd tell you a little about
63_AJJacobs_2007P,what i like to write <unk> and
64_AJJacobs_2007P,i like to
65_AJJacobs_2007P,immerse myself in my topics i just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig <unk>
66_AJJacobs_2007P,and
67_AJJacobs_2007P,i see my life as a series of experiments
68_AJJacobs_2007P,so i work for esquire magazine and a couple of years ago i wrote an article called my outsourced life
69_AJJacobs_2007P,where i hired a team of people in bangalore india to live my life for me <unk> so <unk>
70_AJJacobs_2007P,they answered my emails they answered my phone they argued with my wife for me
71_AJJacobs_2007P,and
72_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> read my son bedtime stories it was the best month of my life <unk> because i just sat back and i
73_AJJacobs_2007P,i read books and watched movies it was a wonderful experience more recently i wrote an article for esquire called
74_AJJacobs_2007P,about radical honesty <unk> and this is a movement where this is started by a psychologist in virginia who says that
75_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> you should never ever lie <unk> except maybe during poker and golf his only exceptions
76_AJJacobs_2007P,and more than that whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth
77_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> so i decided i would try this for a month this was the worst month of my life
78_AJJacobs_2007P,i do not recommend this at all to give you a sense of the of the experience <unk> the article was called i
79_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and it was about the year i spent reading the encyclopedia britannica from a to z in my quest to learn everything in the world
80_AJJacobs_2007P,or more precisely from aak which is a type of east asian music all the way to
81_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> i don 't want to ruin the ending it 's a very
82_AJJacobs_2007P,exciting twist ending like an o henry novel <unk> so i won 't ruin it but i love that one because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb
83_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> although listening to kevin kelly you don 't have to remember anything you can just
84_AJJacobs_2007P,google it so i wasted some time there
85_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> i love those experiments but i think that the most profound and life changing
86_AJJacobs_2007P,experiment that i 've done is my most recent experiment
87_AJJacobs_2007P,where i spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the bible the year of living biblically
88_AJJacobs_2007P,and
89_AJJacobs_2007P,i undertook this for two reasons the first was that i grew up with no religion at all as
90_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> in my book i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian so
91_AJJacobs_2007P,not very
92_AJJacobs_2007P,but i 've become increasingly interested in religion i do think it 's the defining issue of our time or
93_AJJacobs_2007P,one of the main ones and i have a son i want to know what to teach him <unk> so i decided to dive in head first and try to live the bible <unk>
94_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> the second reason i undertook this is because i 'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism religious fundamentalism
95_AJJacobs_2007P,and people who say they take the bible literally <unk> which is according to some polls as high as forty five or fifty percent of america <unk>
96_AJJacobs_2007P,i decided what if you really did take the bible literally <unk> i decided to take it to its logical conclusion
97_AJJacobs_2007P,and and take everything in the bible literally <unk> without picking and choosing the first thing i did was i
98_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> got a stack of bibles <unk> i had christian bibles i had
99_AJJacobs_2007P,jewish bibles a friend of mine sent me something called a hip hop bible
100_AJJacobs_2007P,where the twenty third psalm is rendered as the lord is all that as opposed to what i knew it as the lord is my shepherd
101_AJJacobs_2007P,then i went down and i read
102_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and i wrote down every single law
103_AJJacobs_2007P,that i could find and this was a very long list over seven hundred
104_AJJacobs_2007P,rules
105_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and they range from the famous ones that i had heard of the ten commandments
106_AJJacobs_2007P,love your neighbor be fruitful and multiply <unk> so i wanted to follow those and actually i take my projects very seriously because i had twins during my year so i
107_AJJacobs_2007P,i definitely take my projects seriously <unk> but i
108_AJJacobs_2007P,i also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the bible
109_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> there is the law in leviticus you cannot shave the corners of your beard i didn 't know where my corners were so i decided to let the whole thing grow <unk> and this is what i looked like by the end
110_AJJacobs_2007P,as you can imagine i spent a lot of time at airport security
111_AJJacobs_2007P,my wife wouldn 't kiss me
112_AJJacobs_2007P,for the last two months <unk>
113_AJJacobs_2007P,so <unk> certainly the challenge was there the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers <unk> so i thought sounds strange but i 'll try it you only know if you try it <unk>
114_AJJacobs_2007P,i got rid of all my <unk>
115_AJJacobs_2007P,the bible says that if two men are in a fight and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the
116_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> then her hand shall be cut off <unk> so i wanted to follow that rule
117_AJJacobs_2007P,that one i followed by default by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby <unk>
118_AJJacobs_2007P,looking like she had a strong grip so
119_AJJacobs_2007P,oh there 's another shot of my
120_AJJacobs_2007P,my beard <unk> i will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing and incredibly challenging and there were two types of laws that were particularly
121_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> challenging <unk> the first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day you know
122_AJJacobs_2007P,i could spend a year not killing but spending a year not gossiping not coveting not lying you know i live in new york <unk> and i work as a journalist so this was seventy five eighty percent of my day i had to do it
123_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> but it was really interesting because i was able to
124_AJJacobs_2007P,to make some progress because
125_AJJacobs_2007P,i couldn 't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts this was one of the huge lessons of the year is that i almost pretended to be a better person <unk> and i became a little bit of a better person so
126_AJJacobs_2007P,i had always thought you know you change your mind and you change your behavior but it 's
127_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> often the other way around you change your behavior
128_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and you change your mind so you
129_AJJacobs_2007P,know if you want to become more compassionate <unk> you visit sick people in the hospital <unk> and you will become more compassionate <unk>
130_AJJacobs_2007P,you donate money to a cause <unk> and you become emotionally involved in that cause
131_AJJacobs_2007P,so it really was cognitive psychology
132_AJJacobs_2007P,you know cognitive dissonance that i was experiencing the bible actually talks about cognitive psychology very primitive cognitive psychology in the proverbs it says
133_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> that if you smile you will become happier which as we know is actually true <unk> the second type of
134_AJJacobs_2007P,of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty first century america <unk> and
135_AJJacobs_2007P,perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning
136_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> it 's a big part of the bible so
137_AJJacobs_2007P,i figured i had to address it so i was able to stone one adulterer it happened
138_AJJacobs_2007P,i was in the park <unk> and i was dressed in my biblical clothing so sandals and sort of a white robe <unk> you know because again the outer affects the inner i wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind
139_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and this man came up to me and he said why are you dressed like that and i explained my project
140_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and he said well i am an adulterer <unk> are you going to stone me and i said well that would be great and
141_AJJacobs_2007P,i actually
142_AJJacobs_2007P,took out a handful of of stones from my pocket that i had been carrying around for weeks <unk> hoping for just this
143_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> he grabbed them out of my hand he was actually an elderly man mid 70s just so you know <unk> but he 's still an adulterer <unk> and still quite angry he grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face
144_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and i felt that i could eye for an eye i could retaliate and throw one back at him
145_AJJacobs_2007P,so that was my experience stoning <unk> and it did allow me to
146_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> in a more serious way these big issues how can the bible be so barbaric in some places and yet so incredibly wise in others
147_AJJacobs_2007P,how should we view the bible should we view it you know as original intent like a sort of a scalia version
148_AJJacobs_2007P,of the bible <unk> how was the bible written and actually since this is a tech crowd i talk in the book about
149_AJJacobs_2007P,how the bible actually reminds me of the wikipedia because it has all of these authors and
150_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> editors over hundreds of years and it 's sort of evolved it 's not a book that was written and came down from on high <unk> so
151_AJJacobs_2007P,i thought i would i would end by telling you just a couple of the the take aways the bigger
152_AJJacobs_2007P,lessons that i learned from my year <unk> the first is
153_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> this became very very clear early on because if you do <unk> then you end up acting like a crazy person and stoning adulterers <unk> or here 's another example
154_AJJacobs_2007P,well that 's another i did spend some time shepherding <unk> it 's a very relaxing
155_AJJacobs_2007P,vocation i recommend it <unk> but this one is
156_AJJacobs_2007P,the bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month and more than that you cannot sit on
157_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> a seat where a menstruating woman has sat and my wife thought this was very offensive so she sat in every seat in our apartment <unk>
158_AJJacobs_2007P,and i had to spend much of the year standing until
159_AJJacobs_2007P,i i bought my own seat
160_AJJacobs_2007P,and
161_AJJacobs_2007P,and carried it around <unk> so you know i met with creationists i went to
162_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and these are the ultimate literalists
163_AJJacobs_2007P,and it was fascinating because they were not stupid people at all i would wager that their iq is exactly the same as the average evolutionist it 's just that their faith is so strong
164_AJJacobs_2007P,in this literal interpretation of the bible that they distort all the data to to fit their model <unk> and they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this
165_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> i will say though the museum is gorgeous they really did a fantastic job if you 're ever in kentucky <unk> there 's you can see a movie of the flood and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will
166_AJJacobs_2007P,sprinkle on you during the the flood scenes <unk> so <unk> whatever you think of creationism and i think it 's crazy
167_AJJacobs_2007P,they did a great job
168_AJJacobs_2007P,another lesson is that that thou shalt give thanks and this one was a big
169_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> lesson because i was praying giving these prayers of thanksgiving which was odd for an agnostic <unk> but
170_AJJacobs_2007P,i was saying thanks all the time every day and i started to change my perspective <unk> and i started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day
171_AJJacobs_2007P,that i didn i didn 't even notice that i
172_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong
173_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> so this is actually a key to happiness for me is to just remember when i came over here the car didn 't flip over and i didn 't trip coming up the stairs it 's
174_AJJacobs_2007P,a remarkable thing <unk> third <unk> that thou shall have reverence this one was
175_AJJacobs_2007P,unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic <unk> and by the end of the year i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic
176_AJJacobs_2007P,which i love and i 'm trying to start it as a movement so if anyone wants to join <unk>
177_AJJacobs_2007P,the basic idea is whether or not there is a god there 's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness <unk> and that our rituals can be sacred
178_AJJacobs_2007P,the sabbath can be sacred <unk> this was one of the great things about my year doing the sabbath because i am a
179_AJJacobs_2007P,workaholic so having this one day where you cannot work
180_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> it really that changed my life <unk> so this idea of sacredness whether or not there is a god
181_AJJacobs_2007P,thou shall not stereotype this one happened because i
182_AJJacobs_2007P,i spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout america because i wanted it to be more than about my
183_AJJacobs_2007P,journey i wanted it to be about religion in america <unk> so i spent time with evangelical christians and hasidic
184_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> jews and the amish i 'm very proud because i think i i 'm the only person in america to out bible talk a jehovah 's witness
185_AJJacobs_2007P,after three and a half hours <unk> he looked at his watch he 's like i gotta go
186_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> interesting because i had some very preconceived notions about for instance evangelical christianity and i found that it 's such a wide
187_AJJacobs_2007P,and varied movement that that it is difficult to make
188_AJJacobs_2007P,generalizations about it <unk> there 's a group i met with called the red letter christians <unk> and they focus on the red words in the bible <unk> which are the ones that jesus spoke that 's how they printed them in the old bibles
189_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> and their argument is that jesus never talked about homosexuality <unk> they have a pamphlet that says here 's what jesus said about homosexuality
190_AJJacobs_2007P,and you open it up and there 's nothing in it <unk> so
191_AJJacobs_2007P,they say jesus did talk a lot about
192_AJJacobs_2007P,helping the outcasts helping
193_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> this was very inspiring to me
194_AJJacobs_2007P,i recommend jim wallis and tony campolo
195_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> they 're very inspiring leaders even though i disagree with much of what they say <unk> also thou shalt not disregard the irrational this one was was very
196_AJJacobs_2007P,unexpected because you know i grew up
197_AJJacobs_2007P,with the scientific worldview and
198_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> how much of my my life is governed by irrational forces <unk> and
199_AJJacobs_2007P,the thing is if they 're not harmful <unk> they 're not to be completely dismissed because i learned that
200_AJJacobs_2007P,i was thinking i was doing all these rituals these biblical rituals <unk> separating my wool and linen <unk>
201_AJJacobs_2007P,and i would ask these religious people why would the bible possibly
202_AJJacobs_2007P,tell us to do this why would god care and they said we don 't know but it 's just rituals
203_AJJacobs_2007P,that give us meaning and i would say <unk> but that 's crazy and they would say well what about you you <unk>
204_AJJacobs_2007P,you blow out candles on top of a birthday cake
205_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> if a guy from mars came down and saw <unk>
206_AJJacobs_2007P,here 's one guy
207_AJJacobs_2007P,blowing out the fire on top of a cake
208_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics would the martians say '
209_AJJacobs_2007P,well that guy he makes sense but that guy 's crazy ' so no i think that rituals are
210_AJJacobs_2007P,by nature irrational so the key is to choose the right rituals the ones that
211_AJJacobs_2007P,that are not
212_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed <unk> and finally
213_AJJacobs_2007P,i learned that thou shall pick and choose <unk> and this one i learned because
214_AJJacobs_2007P,i tried to follow everything in the bible <unk> and i failed miserably because you can 't you have to pick and choose and anyone who follows the bible
215_AJJacobs_2007P,is going to be picking and choosing the key is
216_AJJacobs_2007P,to pick and choose the right parts there 's the phrase
217_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> called cafeteria religion <unk> and the fundamentalists will use it
218_AJJacobs_2007P,in a denigrating way and they 'll say oh it 's just cafeteria religion you 're just picking and choosing but my argument is
219_AJJacobs_2007P,what 's wrong with cafeterias i 've had some great meals at cafeterias <unk> i 've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave
220_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> it 's about choosing the parts of the bible about compassion about tolerance about loving your neighbor as opposed to the parts
221_AJJacobs_2007P,about
222_AJJacobs_2007P,homosexuality is a sin <unk> or intolerance or violence <unk> which are very much in the bible as well so if we are to find any meaning in this book <unk>
223_AJJacobs_2007P,then we have to really engage it and wrestle with
224_AJJacobs_2007P,<unk> last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation <unk> hopefully for a good cause which is
225_AJJacobs_2011P,and i 've done this in three parts <unk> so first
226_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> i decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire encyclopedia britannica from a to z or more precisely from a ak to
227_AJJacobs_2011P,zywiec and here 's a little image of that and this was an amazing year it was really a fascinating journey
228_AJJacobs_2011P,so it had its downsides <unk> but
229_AJJacobs_2011P,after that i decided to work on the spirit as i mentioned last year i grew up with no religion at all
230_AJJacobs_2011P,i 'm jewish but i 'm jewish in the same way the olive garden is italian not
231_AJJacobs_2011P,really but i decided to learn about the bible and my heritage
232_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it <unk> so i decided to follow all the rules of the bible and
233_AJJacobs_2011P,from the ten commandments to growing my beard because leviticus says you cannot shave so this is what i looked like by the end
234_AJJacobs_2011P,thank you for that reaction
235_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> i got both of them <unk> so there was the the topiary there and
236_AJJacobs_2011P,there 's the sheep now
237_AJJacobs_2011P,the final part of the trilogy was i wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person i could be the healthiest person alive so that 's what i 've been doing the last couple of years <unk> and i just finished a couple
238_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> and i have to say thank god because living so healthily was killing me
239_AJJacobs_2011P,it was so overwhelming because the amount of things you have to do it 's just
240_AJJacobs_2011P,mind boggling i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers and they were telling me
241_AJJacobs_2011P,all the things i had to do <unk> i had to eat right
242_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> because that lowers the blood pressure <unk> i wrote the book on a treadmill and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book <unk> i had to put on sunscreen this <unk>
243_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> was no small feat because if you listen to dermatologists they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen <unk> and you have to reapply it every two to four hours so i think half of my <unk>
244_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> book advance went into sunscreen <unk> i was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year
245_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> there was the washing of hands i had to do that properly <unk> and my immunologist told me that i should also wipe down all of the remote controls and <unk>
246_AJJacobs_2011P,iphones in my house because those are just orgies of germs <unk> so that took a lot of time <unk>
247_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> because that 's a part of health
248_AJJacobs_2011P,i was inspired by the danish safety council they started a public campaign that says
249_AJJacobs_2011P,a walking helmet is a good helmet so they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking but also for walking around <unk>
250_AJJacobs_2011P,and
251_AJJacobs_2011P,you can see there they 're shopping with their helmets laughter
252_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> i tried that
253_AJJacobs_2011P,now it 's a little extreme i admit but if you think about this this is actually the freakonomics authors wrote about this that more <unk>
254_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving <unk> so
255_AJJacobs_2011P,my cholesterol went down i lost weight my wife stopped telling me that i looked pregnant <unk> so that was nice <unk> and
256_AJJacobs_2011P,it was successful overall but i also learned that i was too healthy and that was unhealthy <unk> i was so focused on doing all these things that i was neglecting my friends and family and as dan buettner can tell you
257_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> having a strong social network is so crucial to our health <unk> so i finished <unk> and i
258_AJJacobs_2011P,i kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over i went to the dark side
259_AJJacobs_2011P,and i just indulged myself it was like something out of caligula without the sex part because
260_AJJacobs_2011P,i have three young kids so that wasn 't happening
261_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> definitely <unk> and i finally
262_AJJacobs_2011P,have stabilized so now i 'm back to adopting many not all i don 't wear a helmet anymore but
263_AJJacobs_2011P,dozens of healthy behaviors that i adopted during
264_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> of course don 't have time to go into all of them let me just tell you two really quickly
265_AJJacobs_2011P,the first is and this was surprising to me i didn 't expect this to come out but i live a much quieter life now
266_AJJacobs_2011P,because we live in such a noisy world
267_AJJacobs_2011P,there 's trains and planes and cars and bill o
268_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> health hazard not just because it harms our hearing <unk> which it obviously does but it actually
269_AJJacobs_2011P,initiates the fight or flight response a loud noise will get your
270_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> fight or flight response going and this <unk> over the years can cause real damage
271_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> cardiovascular damage the world health organization just did a big study that they published this year <unk>
272_AJJacobs_2011P,and <unk> it was done in europe and they estimated that one point six million years of healthy living are lost
273_AJJacobs_2011P,every year in europe
274_AJJacobs_2011P,because of noise pollution <unk> so they think it 's actually very deadly
275_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> impairs cognition and our founding fathers knew about this <unk> when they wrote the constitution they put
276_AJJacobs_2011P,dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate so
277_AJJacobs_2011P,without noise reduction technology our country would not exist so as a patriot
278_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> i felt it was important to i wear all the earplugs and the earphones and it 's really improved my life in
279_AJJacobs_2011P,in a surprising and unexpected way and the second point i want to make the final point is
280_AJJacobs_2011P,that <unk>
281_AJJacobs_2011P,and it 's actually been a theme of tedmed that
282_AJJacobs_2011P,that joy is so important to your health that
283_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> there 's some sense of pleasure and joy in them <unk> and just to give you one instance of this food
284_AJJacobs_2011P,the
285_AJJacobs_2011P,junk food industry is really great at at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what 's the most pleasurable
286_AJJacobs_2011P,but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food to give just one example we
287_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> love crunchiness <unk> mouthfeel <unk> so
288_AJJacobs_2011P,i basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes throw in some sunflower seeds <unk>
289_AJJacobs_2011P,and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you 're eating doritos and
290_AJJacobs_2011P,it has made me a healthier person <unk> so that is it the book about it comes out in april it 's called drop dead healthy and i hope that i don 't get sick during the book tour that 's my greatest hope so thank you very much
291_AJJacobs_2011P,<unk> six months ago <unk> i got an email from a man in israel who had read one of my books
292_AJJacobs_2014A,and the email said you don 't know me <unk> but i 'm your 12th cousin
293_AJJacobs_2014A,and it said i have a family tree with eighty thousand people on it including you
294_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> marx and several european aristocrats
295_AJJacobs_2014A,now i did not know what to make of this part of me was like okay when 's he going to ask me to wire ten thousand dollars to his nigerian bank right
296_AJJacobs_2014A,i also thought eighty thousand relatives do i want that i have enough trouble with
297_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> the ones i have already <unk> and i won 't name names but you know who you are
298_AJJacobs_2014A,but another part of me said this is remarkable <unk> here i am alone in my office but i 'm not alone at all i 'm connected to eighty thousand <unk>
299_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> people around the world and that 's four madison square gardens full of cousins
300_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> but they 're all related to me
301_AJJacobs_2014A,so this email inspired me to dive into genealogy
302_AJJacobs_2014A,which i always thought was a very staid and proper field <unk> but it turns out it 's going through a fascinating revolution and a controversial one
303_AJJacobs_2014A,partly this is because of dna and genetic testing <unk> but partly <unk> it 's because of the internet
304_AJJacobs_2014A,there are sites that now take the wikipedia approach to family trees collaboration
305_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> and crowdsourcing and what you do is you load your family tree on and then these sites search to see if the a j jacobs in your tree
306_AJJacobs_2014A,is the same as the a j jacobs in another tree and if it is then you can combine
307_AJJacobs_2014A,and then you combine and combine and combine until you get these massive mega family trees with thousands of people on them
308_AJJacobs_2014A,or even millions i
309_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> on something on geni called the world family tree <unk> which has no less than a
310_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> you are on it whether you know it or not and you can see the links
311_AJJacobs_2014A,here 's my cousin gwyneth paltrow <unk> she has no idea i exist but
312_AJJacobs_2014A,we are officially cousins we have just seventeen links between us <unk> and

317_AJJacobs_2014A,who is my first cousin 's twice removed 's wife 's niece 's husband 's first cousin once removed 's niece 's husband <unk>
318_AJJacobs_2014A,so six degrees of kevin bacon <unk> plus or minus several degrees
319_AJJacobs_2014A,now i 'm not boasting because all of you have famous people and historical figures in in your tree because we are all connected <unk>
320_AJJacobs_2014A,and seventy five million may seem like a lot but in a few years it 's quite likely we will have a family tree with all almost all seven
321_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> does it really matter what 's the importance <unk> and i do think it is important and i 'll give you five reasons why really quickly first it 's got scientific value
322_AJJacobs_2014A,this is an unprecedented history of the human race <unk>
323_AJJacobs_2014A,and it 's giving us
324_AJJacobs_2014A,valuable data about how diseases are inherited how people migrate and there 's a team of scientists
325_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> mit right now studying the world family tree
326_AJJacobs_2014A,number two <unk> it brings history alive <unk> i found out i 'm connected to albert einstein <unk> so i told my seven year old son that and
327_AJJacobs_2014A,he was totally engaged now albert einstein is not some
328_AJJacobs_2014A,dead white guy with weird hair he 's uncle albert
329_AJJacobs_2014A,and my son wanted to know
330_AJJacobs_2014A,what did he say what is e = mc squared also it 's not all good news <unk> i found a link to jeffrey dahmer the serial killer <unk>
331_AJJacobs_2014A,but i will say that 's on my wife 's side so
332_AJJacobs_2014A,i want to make that clear <unk> sorry honey
333_AJJacobs_2014A,number three interconnectedness we all come from the same ancestor
334_AJJacobs_2014A,and you don 't have to believe the literal bible version
335_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> scientists talk about
336_AJJacobs_2014A,y chromosomal adam and
337_AJJacobs_2014A,mitochondrial eve <unk> and these were about one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand years ago we all have a bit of their dna in us they are our <unk>
338_AJJacobs_2014A,continue that for about seven thousand times grandparents <unk> and so that means we literally all are biological cousins as
339_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> the farthest cousin you have on earth is about a <unk>
340_AJJacobs_2014A,it 's not just ancestors we share <unk> descendants
341_AJJacobs_2014A,if you have kids <unk> and they have kids look how quickly the descendants accumulate so in ten twelve generations you 're going to have thousands of offspring and millions of offspring <unk>
342_AJJacobs_2014A,number four a
343_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> i know that
344_AJJacobs_2014A,there are family feuds i have three sons so i see how they fight <unk>
345_AJJacobs_2014A,but i think that there 's also a human bias to treat your family a little better than strangers <unk> i think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots because
346_AJJacobs_2014A,they 're going to have to realize that they are cousins with thousands of people in whatever ethnic group they happen to to have
347_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> issues with and i think you look back at history
348_AJJacobs_2014A,and a lot of the terrible things we 've done to each other is because one group thinks another group is sub human
349_AJJacobs_2014A,and you can 't do that anymore we 're not just part of the same species we 're part of the same family
350_AJJacobs_2014A,we share ninety nine point nine percent of our dna
351_AJJacobs_2014A,now the final one is
352_AJJacobs_2014A,number five a democratizing effect some genealogy has an elitist strain like people say
353_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> i 'm descended from mary queen of scots and you 're not so you cannot join my country club but
354_AJJacobs_2014A,that 's really going to be hard to do now because everyone is related i 'm descended from mary queen of scots
355_AJJacobs_2014A,by marriage but still <unk> so
356_AJJacobs_2014A,it 's really a fascinating time in the history of family because
357_AJJacobs_2014A,it 's changing so fast there is gay marriage and sperm donors and there 's intermarriage
358_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> on an unprecedented scale and this makes some of my more conservative cousins a little nervous
359_AJJacobs_2014A,but i actually think it 's a good thing <unk> i think the more inclusive the idea of family is the better
360_AJJacobs_2014A,because then you have more potential caretakers <unk> and as my aunt 's eighth cousin
361_AJJacobs_2014A,twice removed hillary clinton
362_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> so i have all these hundreds and thousands millions of new cousins i thought what can i do with this information <unk> and that 's when i decided
363_AJJacobs_2014A,why not throw a party <unk> so that 's what i 'm doing <unk> and you 're all invited
364_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> next year next summer i will be hosting what i hope is the biggest and best family reunion in history

366_AJJacobs_2014A,a great venue <unk> but it 's also on the site of the former world 's fair <unk> which is <unk> i think

368_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> is eleven steps away so i 'm hoping he brings his guitar
369_AJJacobs_2014A,he hasn 't rsvp 'd yet but fingers crossed <unk> and there is going to be a day of speakers of fascinating cousins
370_AJJacobs_2014A,it 's early but i 've already <unk> i 've got some lined up <unk>
371_AJJacobs_2014A,cass sunstein my cousin who is perhaps the most brilliant legal scholar will be

379_AJJacobs_2014A,<unk> over one point five billion people experience armed conflict

381_AalaElKhani_2016X,children without a doubt are the most innocent and vulnerable victims
382_AalaElKhani_2016X,<unk> but not just from the obvious physical dangers <unk> but from the often unspoken effects that wars have on their families <unk>
383_AalaElKhani_2016X,the experiences of war leave children at a real high risk for the development of emotional and behavioral problems
384_AalaElKhani_2016X,children as we can only imagine will feel worried threatened and at risk but there is good news <unk> the quality of care that children receive in their
385_AalaElKhani_2016X,<unk> families
386_AalaElKhani_2016X,can have a more significant effect on their well being than from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to
387_AalaElKhani_2016X,so actually children can be protected
388_AalaElKhani_2016X,by warm secure parenting
389_AalaElKhani_2016X,during and after conflict
390_AalaElKhani_2016X,in two thousand and eleven

393_AalaElKhani_2016X,my family is originally from syria and very early on i lost several family members in really horrifying ways

398_AalaElKhani_2016X,<unk> i began to wonder

400_AalaElKhani_2016X,would my children change
401_AalaElKhani_2016X,would my daughter 's bright happy eyes lose their shine would my son 's really relaxed and carefree nature
402_AalaElKhani_2016X,become fearful and withdrawn <unk> how would i cope <unk> would i change
403_AalaElKhani_2016X,as psychologists and parent trainers we know that arming parents with skills
404_AalaElKhani_2016X,<unk> in caring for their children can have a huge effect on their well being and
405_AalaElKhani_2016X,we call this parent training
406_AalaElKhani_2016X,the question i had was could parent training programs be useful for families while they were still in war zones or refugee camps
407_AalaElKhani_2016X,could we reach them with advice or training that would help them through
408_AalaElKhani_2016X,<unk> i approached my phd supervisor <unk> professor rachel calam with the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world
409_AalaElKhani_2016X,i wasn 't quite sure what exactly i wanted to do
410_AalaElKhani_2016X,she listened carefully and patiently <unk> and then to my joy she said if that 's what you want to do <unk> and it means so much to you then let 's do it
411_AalaElKhani_2016X,let 's find ways to see if parent programs can be useful for families in these contexts
412_AalaElKhani_2016X,so for the past five
413_AalaElKhani_2016X,<unk> years myself and my colleagues <unk> prof calam and dr kim cartwright have been working on ways to support families that have experienced war and displacement <unk>
414_AalaElKhani_2016X,now to know how to help families that have been through conflict support their children <unk> the first step must obviously be to ask them what they 're struggling with <unk>
415_AalaElKhani_2016X,right i mean it seems obvious but it 's often those that are the most vulnerable that we 're trying to support
416_AalaElKhani_2016X,<unk> that we actually don 't ask how many times have we just assumed we know exactly the right thing that 's going to help someone or something without actually asking them first
417_AalaElKhani_2016X,so i travelled to refugee camps in syria and in turkey <unk> and i sat with families and i listened
418_AalaElKhani_2016X,i listened to their parenting challenges i listened to their parenting struggles and i listened to their call for help and sometimes that was

426_AalaElKhani_2016X,they didn 't know how to answer their children 's questions
427_AalaElKhani_2016X,what i found incredibly astonishing and so motivational was that these families were so motivated to support their children <unk> despite all these challenges they faced they were trying to help their children <unk>

437_AalaElKhani_2016X,the families were struggling with with things much bigger than they could cope with the syrian crisis made it clear how incredibly impossible it would be to reach families on an individual level

439_AalaElKhani_2016X,in these terrifying terrifying times
440_AalaElKhani_2016X,after hours of speaking to ngo workers
441_AalaElKhani_2016X,one suggested a fantastic innovative idea of distributing parenting information leaflets via bread wrappers

452_AalaElKhani_2016X,<unk> actually a possible means of delivering psychological first aid that provides warm secure loving parenting

676_AaronKoblin_2011,so zooming back out real quick we see again the u s you get florida down in the right hand corner <unk> moving across to the west coast you see san francisco and los angeles big low traffic zones across nevada and arizona <unk>
677_AaronKoblin_2011,and that 's us down there in l a and long beach on the bottom
678_AaronKoblin_2011,i started taking a look as well at different
679_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> perimeters because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data this is looking at ascending versus descending flights <unk> and you can see over time the ways the airports change <unk> you see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen <unk>
680_AaronKoblin_2011,and you can see <unk> eventually the airport actually flips directions <unk>
681_AaronKoblin_2011,so this is another project that i worked on with the sensible cities lab at mit <unk> this is visualizing international
682_AaronKoblin_2011,how new york communicates with other international cities <unk> and we set this up as a live globe in the museum of modern art in new york for the design the elastic mind exhibition <unk>
683_AaronKoblin_2011,and it had a live feed with a 24 hour offset so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through at & t 's data
684_AaronKoblin_2011,and revealing itself <unk> this is another project i worked on with sensible cities lab and <unk>
685_AaronKoblin_2011,it 's visualizing sms messages being sent in the city of amsterdam
686_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> so you 're seeing the daily ebb and flow of people sending sms messages from different parts of the city <unk> until we approach new year 's eve where everybody says happy new year
687_AaronKoblin_2011,so this is an interactive tool that you can move around and see different parts of the city <unk>
688_AaronKoblin_2011,this is looking at another event this is called queen 's day <unk> so again you get this daily ebb and flow of people sending sms messages from different parts of the city <unk>
689_AaronKoblin_2011,and then you 're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the
690_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> which happens right here <unk> and then you can see people celebrating the next day <unk> and you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases <unk>
691_AaronKoblin_2011,so now on to something completely different some of you may recognize this this is baron wolfgang von kempelen 's mechanical chess playing machine <unk>
692_AaronKoblin_2011,and it 's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well except for one thing it 's not a robot at all there 's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player
693_AaronKoblin_2011,this was the inspiration for a web service
694_AaronKoblin_2011,by amazon called the mechanical turk named after this guy and it 's based on the
695_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> that there are certain things that are easy for people but really difficult for computers
696_AaronKoblin_2011,so they made this web service and said any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people
697_AaronKoblin_2011,the nerdy side of me thought wow this is amazing i can tap into thousands of people 's minds and the other nerdy side of me thought this is
698_AaronKoblin_2011,horrible this is completely bizarre what does this mean for the future of mankind where we
699_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> all plugged into this borg i was probably being a little extreme but what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we 're working on and we 're just doing these little labors
700_AaronKoblin_2011,so i created this drawing tool <unk> i asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left and i said i 'll pay you two cents for your contribution
701_AaronKoblin_2011,and i started collecting sheep <unk>
702_AaronKoblin_2011,and i collected
703_AaronKoblin_2011,a lot a lot of different sheep <unk> lots of sheep <unk> i took the first ten thousand sheep that i collected and i put them on a website called
704_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> buy collections of twenty sheep <unk> you can 't pick individual sheep but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity and juxtaposed against this grid you see actually by rolling over each individual one the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process i think
705_AaronKoblin_2011,there 's something really interesting to watching people as they
706_AaronKoblin_2011,go through this creative toil something we can all relate to this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing <unk> i think it was really interesting to
707_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid <unk> kind of amazing what some people did
708_AaronKoblin_2011,so here 's a few statistics from the project <unk> approximate collection rate of eleven sheep per hour which would make a working wage of sixty nine cents per hour
709_AaronKoblin_2011,there were six hundred and sixty two rejected sheep that didn 't meet sheep like criteria and were thrown out of the flock
710_AaronKoblin_2011,the amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to forty six minutes that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations
711_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> and dedication <unk> and there were seven thousand five hundred and ninety nine
712_AaronKoblin_2011,people that contributed to the project or were unique ip addresses so about how many people contributed <unk>
713_AaronKoblin_2011,but only one of them out of the seven thousand five hundred and ninety nine said this
714_AaronKoblin_2011,which i was pretty surprised by i expected people to
715_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> i think it 's a pretty valid question and
716_AaronKoblin_2011,there 's a lot of reasons why i chose sheep <unk> sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts the first to be selectively bred for production traits the first animal to be cloned <unk> obviously we <unk>
717_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> think of sheep as followers <unk> and there 's this reference to le petit prince where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep <unk> he draws sheep after sheep <unk> the narrator 's only appeased when he draws a box and he says it 's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep <unk> it 's about your own interpretation and doing something different
718_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> this is a clip from charlie chaplin 's modern times it 's showing charlie chaplin dealing with some of the major changes during the industrial revolution <unk>
719_AaronKoblin_2011,so there were no longer shoe makers but now there are people slapping soles on people 's shoes and the whole idea of one 's relationship to their work changed a lot <unk> so i thought this was an interesting clip to divide into sixteen pieces and feed into the mechanical turk with a drawing
720_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> this basically allowed what you see on the left side is the original frame and on the right side you see that frame as interpreted by sixteen people who have no idea what it is they 're doing <unk>
721_AaronKoblin_2011,and this was the inspiration for a project that i worked on with my friend takashi kawashima we decided to use the mechanical turk for exactly what it was meant for which is making money <unk>
722_AaronKoblin_2011,so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into ten thousand teeny pieces and we fed those into the mechanical turk
723_AaronKoblin_2011,we asked people to draw what it was that they
724_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> but here there was no sheep like criteria people if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face it actually made it into the bill <unk> so what you see is actually a representation of how well people did what what it was they were asked to do <unk>
725_AaronKoblin_2011,so we took these hundred dollar bills and we put them on a website called <unk>
726_AaronKoblin_2011,where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions and you can also trade real hundred dollar bills for fake hundred dollar bills and make a donation to the hundred dollar laptop project <unk> which is now known as one laptop per child <unk>
727_AaronKoblin_2011,this is again showing all the different contributions you see some
728_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> did beautiful stipple renderings like this one on top spent a long time making realistic versions
729_AaronKoblin_2011,and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces here on the right hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing $ zero point zero one <unk>
730_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> all i 'm getting paid for this so the last mechanical turk project i 'm going to talk to you about is called bicycle built for two thousand this is a collaboration
731_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> with my friend daniel massey
732_AaronKoblin_2011,you may recognize these two guys this is max mathews and john kelly from bell labs in the ' 60s where they created the song daisy bell which was the world 's first singing computer <unk>
733_AaronKoblin_2011,you may recognize it from two thousand and one a space odyssey when hal 's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song as a reference to when
734_AaronKoblin_2011,computers became human <unk> so we resynthesized this
735_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> this is what that sounded like we broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing <unk>
736_AaronKoblin_2011,and we took all of those individual pieces and we fed them into another turk request <unk> this is what it would look like if you went to the site you type in your code
737_AaronKoblin_2011,but you first test your mic you 'd be fed a simple audio clip
738_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> into the mechanical turk with
739_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> so james surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual we wanted to see how this applies to collaborative distributed music making where nobody has any idea what it is they 're working on
740_AaronKoblin_2011,so if you go <unk>
741_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> bicyclebuiltfortwothousand com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together i 'm sorry for this
742_AaronKoblin_2011,the
743_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> going to grad school i was also working at a place called the center for embedded network sensing and i was writing software to visualize laser scanners <unk> so basically motion through 3d space
744_AaronKoblin_2011,and this was seen by a director in l a named james frost who said wait a minute you mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video
745_AaronKoblin_2011,so we did exactly that we made a music video for one of my favorite bands radiohead <unk>
746_AaronKoblin_2011,and i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers but we also open sourced it and we made it released as a google code project where people could download a bunch of the
747_AaronKoblin_2011,data and some source code to build their own versions of it and people were making some amazing things this is actually two of my favorites the
748_AaronKoblin_2011,pin board thom yorke and a lego thom yorke a whole youtube channel of people submitting really interesting content
749_AaronKoblin_2011,more recently somebody even <unk> 3d printed thom yorke 's head which is a little creepy but pretty cool <unk>
750_AaronKoblin_2011,so with everybody making so much amazing stuff and actually understanding what it was they were working on i was really interested in trying to make a collaborative project where people were working together to build something <unk>
751_AaronKoblin_2011,and i met a music video director named chris milk <unk> and we started bouncing around ideas
752_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> to make a collaborative music video project <unk> but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build build something for
753_AaronKoblin_2011,so we put the idea on the back burner for a few months and he ended up talking to rick rubin who was finishing up johnny cash 's final album called ain 't no grave
754_AaronKoblin_2011,the lyrics to the leading track are ain 't no grave can hold my body down so we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash
755_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> teamed up with my good friend ricardo cabello also known as mr doob who 's a much better programmer than i am <unk> and he made this amazing flash drawing tool as you know an animation is a series of images <unk>
756_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> so what we did was cross cut a bunch of archival footage of johnny cash and at eight frames a second <unk> we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically
757_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> time to play the entire thing for you but i want to show you two short clips one is the beginning of the music video and that 's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly
758_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> what better way to pay tribute to the man than to
759_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> for one of his songs collaborator i felt really sad when he died and i just thought it 'd be wonderful it 'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory
760_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> through problems until my little wee battles that i was fighting within the picture all
761_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> so if you go to the website
762_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> what you 'll see is the video playing above
763_AaronKoblin_2011,and below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project so this isn 't finished at all but it 's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate if you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails <unk>
764_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located <unk> and if you find one that you 're interested in
765_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> you can get the playback and personal contribution in
766_AaronKoblin_2011,addition to that it 's listed the artist 's name the location
767_AaronKoblin_2011,how long they spent drawing it and you can pick a style <unk> so this one was tagged abstract but there 's a bunch of different styles and you can sort the video a number of different ways you can say i want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version <unk>
768_AaronKoblin_2011,and then this is again the abstract version <unk> which ends up getting a little bit crazy
769_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> so the last project i want to talk to you about is another collaboration with chris milk and this is called the wilderness downtown it 's an online music video for the arcade fire chris and i were really amazed by
770_AaronKoblin_2011,the potential now with modern web browsers where you have html5 audio and video and the power of javascript to render amazingly fast and
771_AaronKoblin_2011,we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the web beyond the <unk>
772_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> window and try to make it play
773_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> out and choreograph throughout the screen <unk>
774_AaronKoblin_2011,but most importantly i think we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the johnny cash project where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone
775_AaronKoblin_2011,what if we had a very low commitment but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed <unk>
776_AaronKoblin_2011,so the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up and you type in the address it actually creates a music video specifically for you pulling in google maps and streetview images into the experience itself
777_AaronKoblin_2011,so this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address but i 'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect
778_AaronKoblin_2011,the
779_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> there 's one thing to take away from my talk today it 's that an interface can be a powerful narrative device <unk> and as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data we have an opportunity and maybe even an obligation <unk>
780_AaronKoblin_2011,to maintain the humanity and tell some amazing stories as we explore and collaborate together <unk> thanks a lot
781_AaronKoblin_2011,<unk> this is a representation of your brain <unk> and your brain can be broken into two parts
782_AaronOConnell_2011,there 's the left half which is the logical side and then the right half <unk> which is the intuitive <unk>
783_AaronOConnell_2011,and so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain <unk> and for
784_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> example this would be somebody who 's completely logical this would be someone who 's entirely intuitive <unk>
785_AaronOConnell_2011,so where would you put your brain on this scale
786_AaronOConnell_2011,some of us may have opted for one of these extremes <unk> but i think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time <unk> it 's not like they 're mutually
787_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> exclusive or anything you can be logical and intuitive <unk>
788_AaronOConnell_2011,and so i consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists who
789_AaronOConnell_2011,need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas <unk>
790_AaronOConnell_2011,but at the same time we
791_AaronOConnell_2011,need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work
792_AaronOConnell_2011,how do we develop this intuition well we like to play with stuff <unk> so we go out and play with it and then we see how it acts <unk> and then we develop
793_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> from there and really you do the same thing
794_AaronOConnell_2011,so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time
795_AaronOConnell_2011,i mean it can sound weird to think about
796_AaronOConnell_2011,one thing being in two different places at the same time <unk> but you weren 't born with this notion you developed it
797_AaronOConnell_2011,and i remember watching a kid playing on a car stop
798_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> just a toddler and he wasn 't very good at it and he kept falling over <unk> but i bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson and that 's that large things don 't let you get right past them <unk>
799_AaronOConnell_2011,and that they stay in one place <unk>
800_AaronOConnell_2011,and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world <unk> unless you 're a particle physicist it 'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don 't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles
801_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> and when they play with their particles they find they do all sorts of really weird weird things like they can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time <unk>
802_AaronOConnell_2011,and so they wrote down all these observations <unk> and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics <unk>
803_AaronOConnell_2011,and so that 's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny
804_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> but you didn 't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us
805_AaronOConnell_2011,this didn 't really sit well with my intuition <unk> and maybe it 's just because i don 't play with particles very often
806_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> well i play with them sometimes but not very often <unk> and i 've never seen them <unk> i mean <unk> nobody 's ever seen a particle
807_AaronOConnell_2011,but it didn 't sit well with my logical side either because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics
808_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> then shouldn 't everything just follow quantum mechanics
809_AaronOConnell_2011,i don 't see any reason why it shouldn 't
810_AaronOConnell_2011,and so i 'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics <unk> so a few years ago i set off to do just that
811_AaronOConnell_2011,i made one this is the first object
812_AaronOConnell_2011,that you can see
813_AaronOConnell_2011,that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition
814_AaronOConnell_2011,so what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip <unk> and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle <unk> and that 's this piece of metal i 'm going to be talking about in a minute
815_AaronOConnell_2011,this is a photograph of of the object and here i 'll zoom in a little bit we 're looking right there in the center <unk>
816_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> 're looking at is a little chunk of metal and it 's shaped like a diving board and it 's sticking out over a ledge <unk> and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip i went into a clean room with <unk>
817_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> a fresh silicon wafer <unk> and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about one hundred hours for the last stuff i had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device
818_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> needs a little help to do it here let me give you an analogy you
819_AaronOConnell_2011,know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator <unk> i mean when i 'm in an elevator all alone i do all sorts of weird things but then other people
820_AaronOConnell_2011,get on board and i stop doing those things because
821_AaronOConnell_2011,i don 't want to bother them or frankly <unk> scare them <unk>
822_AaronOConnell_2011,so quantum mechanics quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way the fellow passengers for
823_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> inanimate objects are not just people <unk> but it 's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room <unk>
824_AaronOConnell_2011,and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically we 're going to have to kick out all the other passengers <unk> and so that 's what we did
825_AaronOConnell_2011,we turned off the lights and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air <unk> and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero
826_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted <unk> and so we measured its motion we found it was moving in really weird ways <unk> instead of just sitting perfectly still <unk>
827_AaronOConnell_2011,it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and contracting bellows and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time
828_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> mechanics <unk> so what i 'm telling you here is something truly fantastic
829_AaronOConnell_2011,what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time <unk>
830_AaronOConnell_2011,so let 's think about the atoms so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and
831_AaronOConnell_2011,at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down now it 's only at precise times
832_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> they align the rest of the time they 're delocalized
833_AaronOConnell_2011,that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time <unk> which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places i think this is really cool
834_AaronOConnell_2011,really it
835_AaronOConnell_2011,was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years
836_AaronOConnell_2011,because check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you
837_AaronOConnell_2011,so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time <unk> that chunk of metal can be in two different places
838_AaronOConnell_2011,then why not you i mean
839_AaronOConnell_2011,this is just my logical side talking <unk>
840_AaronOConnell_2011,so imagine if you 're in
841_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> multiple places at the same time <unk> what would that be like
842_AaronOConnell_2011,how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space
843_AaronOConnell_2011,there 's one more part to the story it 's when we warmed it up and
844_AaronOConnell_2011,we turned on the lights and looked inside the box we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece <unk> and so i had to develop this new intuition
845_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space
846_AaronOConnell_2011,you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected
847_AaronOConnell_2011,well that 's not quite right it 's more than that
848_AaronOConnell_2011,it 's deeper it 's that those connections your connections to all the things around you <unk> literally define who you are
849_AaronOConnell_2011,and that 's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics <unk> thank you
850_AaronOConnell_2011,<unk> most of us think of motion as a very visual thing if
851_AaronOConnell_2011,i walk across this stage or gesture with my hands while i speak that motion is something that you can see
852_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> but there 's a world of important motion that 's too subtle for the human eye <unk>
853_AbeDavis_2015,and over the past few years we 've started to find that cameras can often see this motion even when humans can 't
854_AbeDavis_2015,so let me show you what i mean
855_AbeDavis_2015,on the left here you see video of a person 's wrist <unk>
856_AbeDavis_2015,and on the right you see video of a sleeping infant but if i didn 't tell you that these were videos you might assume that you were looking at two regular
857_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> images because in both cases these videos appear to be almost completely still
858_AbeDavis_2015,but there 's actually a lot of subtle motion going on here <unk>
859_AbeDavis_2015,and if you were to touch the wrist on the left you would feel a pulse <unk> and if you were to hold the infant on the right
860_AbeDavis_2015,you would feel the rise and fall of her chest as she took each breath
861_AbeDavis_2015,and these motions carry a lot of
862_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> significance <unk> but they 're usually too subtle for us to see <unk>
863_AbeDavis_2015,so instead we have to observe them through direct contact through touch <unk>
864_AbeDavis_2015,but a few years ago <unk> my colleagues at mit developed what they call a motion microscope <unk>
865_AbeDavis_2015,which is software that finds these subtle motions in video
866_AbeDavis_2015,and amplifies them so that they become large enough for us to see
867_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> and so if we use their software on the left video <unk>
868_AbeDavis_2015,it lets us see the pulse in this wrist <unk> and if we were to count that pulse we could even figure out this person 's heart rate <unk>
869_AbeDavis_2015,and if we used the same software on the right video <unk> it lets us see each breath that this infant takes <unk> and we can use this as a
870_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> to monitor her breathing <unk> and so this technology is really powerful
871_AbeDavis_2015,because it takes these phenomena that we normally have to experience through touch
872_AbeDavis_2015,and it lets us capture them visually and non invasively
873_AbeDavis_2015,so a couple years ago <unk> i started working with the folks that created that software <unk> and we decided to pursue a crazy idea <unk>
874_AbeDavis_2015,we thought it 's cool
875_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> that we can use software to visualize tiny motions like this and you can almost think of it as a way to extend our sense of touch <unk>
876_AbeDavis_2015,but what if we could do the same thing with our ability to hear
877_AbeDavis_2015,what if we could use video to capture the vibrations of sound <unk>
878_AbeDavis_2015,which are just another kind of motion and turn everything that we see into a microphone now
879_AbeDavis_2015,this is a bit of a strange idea <unk> so let me try to put it in perspective for
880_AbeDavis_2015,traditional microphones work by converting the motion of an internal diaphragm into an electrical signal <unk>
881_AbeDavis_2015,and that diaphragm is designed to move readily with sound
882_AbeDavis_2015,so that its motion can be recorded and interpreted as audio <unk> but sound causes all objects to
883_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see so what if we record them with a high speed camera
884_AbeDavis_2015,and then use software to extract tiny motions from our high speed video
885_AbeDavis_2015,and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them
886_AbeDavis_2015,this would let us turn visible objects into
887_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> visual microphones from a distance
888_AbeDavis_2015,and so we tried this out and here 's one of our experiments where we took this potted plant that you see on the right
889_AbeDavis_2015,and we filmed it with a high speed camera while a nearby loudspeaker played this sound
890_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> it at thousands of frames per second <unk>
891_AbeDavis_2015,but even if you look very closely all you 'll see are some leaves that are pretty much just sitting there doing nothing <unk>
892_AbeDavis_2015,because our sound only moved those leaves by about a micrometer that 's one
893_AbeDavis_2015,of a centimeter <unk> which spans somewhere between a hundredth and a thousandth of a pixel in
894_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> this image <unk> so you can squint all you want <unk> but motion that small is pretty much perceptually invisible
895_AbeDavis_2015,but it turns out that something can be perceptually invisible and still be numerically significant <unk>
896_AbeDavis_2015,because with the right algorithms we can take this silent
897_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> how is this possible how can we get so much information out of so little motion well let 's say
898_AbeDavis_2015,that those leaves move by just a single micrometer <unk> and let 's say that that shifts our image by just a thousandth of a pixel
899_AbeDavis_2015,that may not seem like much <unk> but a single frame of video may have hundreds of thousands of pixels in it <unk>
900_AbeDavis_2015,and so if we combine all of the tiny motions that we see from across that entire image <unk> then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel
901_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> pixel can start to add up to something pretty significant on a personal note we were pretty psyched when we figured this out
902_AbeDavis_2015,laughter but
903_AbeDavis_2015,even with the right algorithm <unk> we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle
904_AbeDavis_2015,you see there are a lot of factors that affect when and how well this technique will work <unk> there 's the object and how far away it
905_AbeDavis_2015,there 's the camera and the lens that you use how much light is shining on the object and how loud your sound is
906_AbeDavis_2015,and even with the right algorithm <unk>
907_AbeDavis_2015,we had to be very careful with our early experiments <unk> because if we got any of these factors wrong there was no way to tell what the problem was we would just get noise back
908_AbeDavis_2015,and so a lot of our early experiments looked like this
909_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> and so here i am <unk>
910_AbeDavis_2015,and on the bottom left you can kind of see our high speed camera <unk> which is pointed at a bag of chips <unk> and the whole thing is lit by these bright lamps <unk>
911_AbeDavis_2015,and like i said <unk> we had to be very careful in these early experiments <unk> so this is how it went down
912_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> so this experiment looks completely ridiculous
913_AbeDavis_2015,i mean i 'm screaming at a bag of chips and we 're blasting it with so much light we literally melted the first bag we tried this
914_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> and this was really significant <unk> because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object
915_AbeDavis_2015,and so it gave us this point of reference
916_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> and gradually we could start to modify the experiment
917_AbeDavis_2015,using different objects or moving the object further away <unk> using less light or quieter sounds
918_AbeDavis_2015,and we analyzed all of these experiments until we really understood the limits of our technique <unk>
919_AbeDavis_2015,because once we understood those limits we could figure out how to push them
920_AbeDavis_2015,and that led to experiments like this one
921_AbeDavis_2015,where again i 'm going to speak to a bag of chips <unk>
922_AbeDavis_2015,but this time we 've moved our camera about fifteen feet away outside behind a soundproof window <unk>
923_AbeDavis_2015,and the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight
924_AbeDavis_2015,and so here 's the video that we captured and this is what
925_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> and here 's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside behind that window
926_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> there are other ways that we can push these limits as well <unk> so here 's a quieter experiment
927_AbeDavis_2015,where we filmed some earphones plugged into a laptop computer <unk> and in this case our goal was to recover the music that was playing on that laptop
928_AbeDavis_2015,from just silent video of these two little plastic earphones
929_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> and we were able to do this so well that i could even shazam our results
930_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> we can also push things by changing the hardware that we use
931_AbeDavis_2015,because the experiments i 've shown you so far were done with a camera a high speed camera that can record video about a one hundred times faster than most cell phones <unk>
932_AbeDavis_2015,but we 've also found a way to use this technique with more regular cameras
933_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> and we do that by taking advantage of what 's called a rolling shutter
934_AbeDavis_2015,you see most cameras record images one row at a time <unk> and so if an object moves during
935_AbeDavis_2015,the recording of a single image <unk> there 's a slight time delay between each row <unk> and this causes
936_AbeDavis_2015,slight artifacts that get coded into each frame of a video <unk> and so what we found
937_AbeDavis_2015,is that by analyzing these artifacts we can actually recover sound
938_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> sound using a modified version of our algorithm <unk>
939_AbeDavis_2015,so here 's an experiment we did where we filmed a bag of candy while a nearby loudspeaker played the same mary had a little lamb music from before <unk>
940_AbeDavis_2015,but this time we used just a regular store bought camera
941_AbeDavis_2015,and so in a second i 'll play for you the sound that we recovered and it 's going to sound distorted this
942_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> that sounds distorted
943_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> what 's really amazing here
944_AbeDavis_2015,is that we were able to do this with something that you could literally run out and pick up at a best buy <unk>
945_AbeDavis_2015,so at this point a lot of people see this work and they immediately think about surveillance <unk> and
946_AbeDavis_2015,to be fair it 's not hard to imagine how you might use this technology to spy on someone <unk> but
947_AbeDavis_2015,keep in mind that there 's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance in fact
948_AbeDavis_2015,people have been using lasers to eavesdrop on objects from a distance for decades <unk>
949_AbeDavis_2015,but what 's really new here what 's really different is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object
950_AbeDavis_2015,which gives us a new lens through which to look at the world <unk>
951_AbeDavis_2015,and we can use that lens to learn not just about forces like sound that cause an object to vibrate <unk>
952_AbeDavis_2015,but also about the object
953_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> itself <unk>
954_AbeDavis_2015,and so i want to take a step back and and think about how that might change the ways that we use video <unk>
955_AbeDavis_2015,because we usually use video to look at things and i 've just shown you how we can use it to listen to things <unk>
956_AbeDavis_2015,but there 's another important way that we learn about the world that 's by interacting with it
957_AbeDavis_2015,we push and pull and poke and prod things we
958_AbeDavis_2015,shake things and see what happens <unk> and that 's something that video still won 't let us do
959_AbeDavis_2015,at least not traditionally <unk>
960_AbeDavis_2015,so i want to show you some new work <unk> and this is based on an idea i had just a few months ago <unk> so this is actually the first time i 've shown it to a public audience <unk>
961_AbeDavis_2015,and the basic idea is that we 're going to use the vibrations in a video
962_AbeDavis_2015,to capture objects in a way that
963_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> will let us interact with them
964_AbeDavis_2015,and see how they react to us <unk>
965_AbeDavis_2015,so here 's an object and in this case it 's a wire figure in the shape of a human <unk>
966_AbeDavis_2015,and we 're going to film that object with just a regular camera <unk> so there 's nothing special about this camera in fact i 've actually done this with my cell phone before <unk>
967_AbeDavis_2015,but we do want to see the object vibrate <unk> so to make that happen we 're just going to bang a little bit on the surface
968_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> surface where it 's resting while we record this video
969_AbeDavis_2015,so that 's it just five seconds of regular video <unk> while we bang on this surface <unk>
970_AbeDavis_2015,and we 're going to use the vibrations in that video
971_AbeDavis_2015,to learn about the structural and material properties of our object and we 're going to use that information
972_AbeDavis_2015,to create something new and interactive <unk>
973_AbeDavis_2015,and so here 's what we 've created
974_AbeDavis_2015,and it looks like a regular image <unk> but this isn 't an image and it 's not a video <unk>
975_AbeDavis_2015,because now i can take my mouse and i can start interacting with the object
976_AbeDavis_2015,and so what you see here
977_AbeDavis_2015,is a simulation of how this object would respond to new forces that we 've never seen before <unk>
978_AbeDavis_2015,and we created it from just five seconds of regular video
979_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> so this is a really powerful way to look at the world <unk> because it lets us predict how objects will respond to new situations <unk>
980_AbeDavis_2015,and you could imagine for instance looking at an old bridge
981_AbeDavis_2015,and wondering what would happen how would that bridge hold up if i were
982_AbeDavis_2015,drive my car across it and that 's a question that you probably want to answer before you start driving across that bridge
983_AbeDavis_2015,and of course there are going to be limitations to this technique just like there were with the visual microphone <unk> but
984_AbeDavis_2015,we found that it works in a lot of situations that you might not expect <unk>
985_AbeDavis_2015,especially if you give it longer videos <unk> so for example here 's a video that i captured of a bush outside of my apartment <unk>
986_AbeDavis_2015,and i didn 't do anything to this bush
987_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> but by capturing a minute long video a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations
988_AbeDavis_2015,that we could learn enough about this bush to create this simulation
989_AbeDavis_2015,and so you could imagine giving this
990_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> and letting him control <unk> say the strength and direction of wind in a shot after it 's been recorded
991_AbeDavis_2015,or in this case <unk> we pointed our camera at a hanging curtain <unk>
992_AbeDavis_2015,and you can 't even see any motion in this video <unk>
993_AbeDavis_2015,but by recording a two minute long video <unk> natural air currents in this room created enough subtle
994_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> imperceptible motions and vibrations that we could learn enough to create this simulation <unk>
995_AbeDavis_2015,and
996_AbeDavis_2015,ironically we 're kind of used to having this kind of interactivity when it comes to virtual objects
997_AbeDavis_2015,when it comes to video games and 3d models <unk>
998_AbeDavis_2015,but to be able to capture this information from real objects in the real world using just simple
999_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> is something new that has a lot of potential <unk> so
1000_AbeDavis_2015,here are the amazing people who worked with me on these projects applause
1001_AbeDavis_2015,and what i 've shown you <unk>
1002_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> today is only the beginning <unk> we 've just started to scratch the surface of what you can do with this kind of imaging <unk>
1003_AbeDavis_2015,to capture our surroundings with common accessible technology <unk>
1004_AbeDavis_2015,and so looking to the future it 's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world
1005_AbeDavis_2015,<unk> i was in new york during hurricane sandy <unk> and this little white dog called maui was staying with me <unk>
1006_AbeDavis_2015,half the city was dark because of a power cut <unk> and i was living on the dark side
1007_AbhaDawesar_2013G,now maui was terrified of the dark so i had to carry him up the stairs actually down the stairs first
1008_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> for his walk <unk> and then bring him back up i was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day <unk>
1009_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and through all of this i had to hold a torch between my teeth <unk> the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries
1010_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and bread for a shower <unk> i walked forty blocks to a branch of my gym <unk> but these were not the major preoccupations of my day
1011_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> it was just as critical for me to be the first person in at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers to juice my multiple devices <unk> i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points <unk>
1012_AbhaDawesar_2013G,i wasn 't the only one <unk> even in the rain people stood between madison and 5th avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street
1013_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> had just reminded us
1014_AbhaDawesar_2013G,that it was stronger than all our technology <unk> and yet here we were obsessed about being wired
1015_AbhaDawesar_2013G,i think there 's nothing like a crisis to tell you what 's really important and what 's not
1016_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and sandy made me realize
1017_AbhaDawesar_2013G,that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food
1018_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> and shelter
1019_AbhaDawesar_2013G,the self as we once knew it no longer exists <unk>
1020_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and i think that an abstract digital universe has become a part of our identity
1021_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and i want to talk to you about what i think that means
1022_AbhaDawesar_2013G,i 'm a novelist and i 'm interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common they 're both stories <unk> interpretations
1023_AbhaDawesar_2013G,you and i can experience things without a story we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless
1024_AbhaDawesar_2013G,but the larger sense that we have of our lives the slightly more abstract one is indirect
1025_AbhaDawesar_2013G,our story of our life is based on direct experience <unk> but it 's embellished
1026_AbhaDawesar_2013G,a novel needs scene after scene to build and the story of our life needs an arc as well
1027_AbhaDawesar_2013G,it needs months and years <unk> discrete moments from our lives are its chapters <unk> but the story is not about these
1028_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> chapters it 's the whole book <unk>
1029_AbhaDawesar_2013G,it 's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness the victories and the disappointments <unk>
1030_AbhaDawesar_2013G,but it 's because how because of these and sometimes more importantly in spite of these we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves
1031_AbhaDawesar_2013G,our story therefore needs two dimensions of time a long arc of time that is our lifespan
1032_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment
1033_AbhaDawesar_2013G,now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment <unk> but the one that narrates needs several moments a whole sequence of them <unk>
1034_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and that 's why our full sense of self needs both
1035_AbhaDawesar_2013G,immersive experience and the flow of time <unk>
1036_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> the flow of time is embedded in everything in the erosion of a grain of sand in the budding
1037_AbhaDawesar_2013G,of a little bud into a rose without it <unk> we would have no music our own emotions and state of mind often encode time <unk>
1038_AbhaDawesar_2013G,regret or nostalgia about the past <unk> hope or dread about the future <unk>
1039_AbhaDawesar_2013G,i think that technology has altered
1040_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> the overall time that we have for our narrative our lifespan has been increasing but the smallest measure the moment has shrunk <unk>
1041_AbhaDawesar_2013G,it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time <unk>
1042_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world
1043_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and this granular understanding has generated reams of data
1044_AbhaDawesar_2013G,that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers
1045_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> of this to say that the gap between what we can perceive and what we can measure is only going to widen <unk>
1046_AbhaDawesar_2013G,science can do things with and in a picosecond but you and i are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second
1047_AbhaDawesar_2013G,you and i
1048_AbhaDawesar_2013G,answer only to nature 's rhythm and flow to the
1049_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> the moon and the seasons <unk>
1050_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past the present and the future to see things for what they are to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations
1051_AbhaDawesar_2013G,we need time 's arrow to understand cause and effect not just in the material world but in our own intentions and our motivations
1052_AbhaDawesar_2013G,what happens
1053_AbhaDawesar_2013G,when that arrow goes awry what happens when time warps so
1054_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> many of us today have the sensation that time 's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once
1055_AbhaDawesar_2013G,this is because time doesn 't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one
1056_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> we all know that the internet has shrunk space as well as time <unk> far away over there is now here <unk> news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether i 'm in new york or new delhi
1057_AbhaDawesar_2013G,your last job your dinner reservations from last year your former friends lie on a flat plain with today 's friends because the internet also archives and it warps the past
1058_AbhaDawesar_2013G,with no distinction left between the past <unk> the present and the future and the here or there we are left with this moment everywhere
1059_AbhaDawesar_2013G,this moment that i 'll call the digital now just how can we prioritize in the
1060_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> landscape of the digital now
1061_AbhaDawesar_2013G,this digital now is not the present because it 's always a few seconds ahead with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones
1062_AbhaDawesar_2013G,this isn 't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book <unk>
1063_AbhaDawesar_2013G,this now bears very little
1064_AbhaDawesar_2013G,physical or psychological reference to our own state its focus instead is to distract us at every turn on the road
1065_AbhaDawesar_2013G,every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else are you reading an interview by an author why not buy his book <unk> tweet <unk>
1066_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> it <unk> share it <unk> like it <unk> find other books exactly like his <unk> find other people reading those books
1067_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> choice is freedom but not when it 's constantly for its own sake not just is the digital now far from the present but it 's in direct competition with it
1068_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and this is because not just am i absent from it <unk> but so are you not just are we absent from it but so is everyone else and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror <unk> i
1069_AbhaDawesar_2013G,i can order foreign language books in the middle of the night shop for parisian macarons and leave video messages that get picked up later at all times i can operate at a different rhythm and <unk>
1070_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> pace from you while i sustain the illusion that i 'm tapped into you in real time <unk>
1071_AbhaDawesar_2013G,for some reason technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does <unk>
1072_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and then like an ironic slap in the face it makes it true
1073_AbhaDawesar_2013G,for example it 's said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets
1074_AbhaDawesar_2013G,now if this rift which is already so great in many parts of the world between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology isn 't somehow bridged
1075_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> will be ruptures between the digital and the real for us
1076_AbhaDawesar_2013G,as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it
1077_AbhaDawesar_2013G,the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous
1078_AbhaDawesar_2013G,how does one live inside distraction
1079_AbhaDawesar_2013G,we might think that those younger than us those who are born into this will adapt more naturally
1080_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> possibly <unk> but i remember my childhood i remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me
1081_AbhaDawesar_2013G,buda and pest were separated by the danube and vienna had a spanish riding school
1082_AbhaDawesar_2013G,if i were a child today i could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks <unk> but it really wouldn 't be the same because
1083_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> i went to vienna <unk> and i went to the spanish riding school <unk> and i could feel my grandfather right beside me
1084_AbhaDawesar_2013G,night after night he took me up on the terrace on his shoulders <unk> and pointed out jupiter and saturn and the great bear to me
1085_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and even here when i look at the great bear i get back that feeling of being a child
1086_AbhaDawesar_2013G,hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder <unk>
1087_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and i can get back that feeling of being a child again what i had
1088_AbhaDawesar_2013G,<unk> with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact <unk>
1089_AbhaDawesar_2013G,but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact
1090_AbhaDawesar_2013G,time warping technology challenges our deepest core because
1091_AbhaDawesar_2013G,we are able to archive the past
1092_AbhaDawesar_2013G,and some of it becomes

1101_AbhaDawesar_2013G,for a whole month

1117_AbigailMarsh_2016T,burning <unk> gnawing need to understand why he did it
1118_AbigailMarsh_2016T,what forces within him caused him to make the choice that i owe my life to to risk his own life to save the life of a stranger in other words
1119_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> are the causes of his or anybody else 's capacity for altruism <unk>
1120_AbigailMarsh_2016T,but first let me tell you what happened that night i was nineteen years old and driving back to my home in tacoma washington down the interstate five freeway <unk>
1121_AbigailMarsh_2016T,when a little dog darted out in front of my car <unk>
1122_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and i did exactly what you 're not supposed to do which is swerve to avoid it <unk>
1123_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and i discovered why you 're not supposed to do that
1124_AbigailMarsh_2016T,i hit the dog anyways and that sent the car
1125_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> into a fishtail <unk> and then a spin across the freeway <unk> until finally it wound up in the fast lane of the freeway
1126_AbigailMarsh_2016T,faced backwards into oncoming traffic
1127_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and then the engine died <unk>
1128_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and i was sure in that moment that i was about to die too <unk> but i didn 't because of the actions of that one brave man
1129_AbigailMarsh_2016T,who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second of seeing my
1130_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> stranded car to pull over and run across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark
1131_AbigailMarsh_2016T,to save my life and then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety and made sure i was going to be all right
1132_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> he drove off again he
1133_AbigailMarsh_2016T,never even told me his name <unk>
1134_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and i 'm pretty sure i forgot to say thank you
1135_AbigailMarsh_2016T,so before i go any further
1136_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> i really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you to that stranger i
1137_AbigailMarsh_2016T,tell you all of this because the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree
1138_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> i became a psychology researcher and i 've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
1139_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> does it come from and how does it develop and what are the extreme forms that it can take these questions are really important to understanding basic aspects of human social nature
1140_AbigailMarsh_2016T,a lot of people and this includes everybody from philosophers and economists to ordinary people
1141_AbigailMarsh_2016T,believe that human nature is fundamentally selfish that we 're only ever really motivated by our own welfare <unk> but if that 's true why do some people
1142_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> people like the stranger who rescued me do selfless things like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves <unk>
1143_AbigailMarsh_2016T,answering this question requires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism
1144_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and what might make people who engage in such acts different than other people <unk>
1145_AbigailMarsh_2016T,but until recently very little work on this topic had been done
1146_AbigailMarsh_2016T,the actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
1147_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> definition of altruism <unk> which is a voluntary costly behavior motivated by the desire to help another individual
1148_AbigailMarsh_2016T,so it 's a selfless act intended to benefit only the other what could possibly explain an action like that
1149_AbigailMarsh_2016T,one answer is compassion obviously which is a key driver of altruism <unk> but then the question becomes why do some people seem to have more of it than others
1150_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> and the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways <unk>
1151_AbigailMarsh_2016T,but to figure out how i actually started from the opposite end
1152_AbigailMarsh_2016T,with psychopaths
1153_AbigailMarsh_2016T,a common approach to understanding basic aspects of human nature like the desire to help other people is to study people in whom that desire is missing <unk>
1154_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and psychopaths are exactly such a group
1155_AbigailMarsh_2016T,psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins <unk>
1156_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and it results in a personality that 's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior
1157_AbigailMarsh_2016T,once my colleagues and i at the national institute of mental health conducted some of the first ever brain imaging research of psychopathic
1158_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> and our findings and the findings of other researchers now have shown that people who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit three characteristics <unk>
1159_AbigailMarsh_2016T,first although they 're not generally insensitive to other people 's emotions they are insensitive to signs that other people are in distress <unk>
1160_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and in particular they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one
1161_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and fearful expressions convey urgent need and emotional distress <unk> and they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help
1162_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> people who see them so it makes sense that people who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues
1163_AbigailMarsh_2016T,the part of the brain that 's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala
1164_AbigailMarsh_2016T,there are very rare cases of people who lack amygdalas completely <unk> and they 're profoundly impaired in recognizing fearful expressions <unk>
1165_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes in amygdala
1166_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> activity when they look at fearful expressions
1167_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> to these expressions sometimes they don 't react at all which may be why they have trouble detecting these cues <unk>
1168_AbigailMarsh_2016T,finally <unk> psychopaths ' amygdalas are smaller than average by about eighteen or twenty percent <unk> so
1169_AbigailMarsh_2016T,all of these findings are reliable
1170_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> and they 're very interesting <unk> but remember that my main interest is not understanding why people don 't care about others it 's understanding why they do
1171_AbigailMarsh_2016T,so the real question is could extraordinary altruism <unk> which is the opposite of psychopathy
1172_AbigailMarsh_2016T,in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy a sort of
1173_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> better able to recognize other people 's fear <unk>
1174_AbigailMarsh_2016T,an amygdala that 's more reactive to this expression and maybe larger than average as well
1175_AbigailMarsh_2016T,as my research has now shown all three things are true <unk>
1176_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and we discovered this by testing a population of truly extraordinary altruists these are people who have given one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger <unk>
1177_AbigailMarsh_2016T,so these are people who have volunteered
1178_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed
1179_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they 've never met and may never meet why would anybody do this is a very common question <unk>
1180_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and the answer may be that the brains of these extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics <unk>
1181_AbigailMarsh_2016T,they are better at recognizing other people 's fear <unk> they 're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress
1182_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> this may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions <unk> and remember this is the same part of the brain that we found was underreactive in people who are psychopathic <unk>
1183_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and finally their <unk> amygdalas are larger than average as well by about eight percent <unk>
1184_AbigailMarsh_2016T,so together what these data suggest is the existence of something like a caring continuum in the world
1185_AbigailMarsh_2016T,that 's anchored at the one end by people who are highly psychopathic <unk> and at the other by people who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism
1186_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different
1187_AbigailMarsh_2016T,is not just that they 're more compassionate than average they are
1188_AbigailMarsh_2016T,but what 's even more unusual about them is that they 're compassionate and altruistic not just towards people who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family
1189_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> right because to have compassion for people that you love and identify with is not
1190_AbigailMarsh_2016T,extraordinary truly extraordinary altruists
1191_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> extends way beyond that circle even beyond their wider circle of acquaintances to people who are outside their social circle altogether <unk>
1192_AbigailMarsh_2016T,total strangers just like the man who rescued me <unk>
1193_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and i 've had the opportunity now to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate such a wide circle of compassion
1194_AbigailMarsh_2016T,that they were willing to give a complete stranger their kidney <unk> and i found it 's a really difficult
1195_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> question for them to answer <unk> i say
1196_AbigailMarsh_2016T,how is it that you 're willing to do this thing when so many other people don 't you
1197_AbigailMarsh_2016T,'re one of fewer than two thousand americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger what is it that makes you so special
1198_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and what do they say
1199_AbigailMarsh_2016T,they say nothing
1200_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> there 's nothing special about me <unk> i 'm just the same as everybody else
1201_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and i think that 's actually a really telling answer <unk> because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don 't look like this
1202_AbigailMarsh_2016T,they look more like this they have no center
1203_AbigailMarsh_2016T,these altruists literally don 't think of themselves as being at the center of anything as being better or more inherently important
1204_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> than anybody else when i asked one altruist why donating her kidney made sense to her she said because it 's not about me
1205_AbigailMarsh_2016T,another said
1206_AbigailMarsh_2016T,i 'm not different <unk> i 'm not unique <unk> your study here is going to find out that i 'm just the same as you i think the best description for this amazing lack of <unk>
1207_AbigailMarsh_2016T,is humility <unk> which is that quality that in the words of st augustine makes men as angels <unk> and why is that
1208_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> because if there 's no center of your circle there can be no inner rings or outer rings nobody who is more or less worthy of your care and compassion than anybody else <unk>
1209_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and i think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person <unk>
1210_AbigailMarsh_2016T,but i also think that this is a view of the world that 's attainable by many and maybe even most people
1211_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> and i think this because at the societal level <unk> expansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere
1212_AbigailMarsh_2016T,the psychologist steven pinker and others have shown that all around the world people are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever widening circles of others <unk>
1213_AbigailMarsh_2016T,which has led to declines of all kinds of cruelty and violence from animal abuse to domestic violence to capital punishment <unk>
1214_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and it 's led to increases in all kinds of
1215_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> a hundred years ago people would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today
1216_AbigailMarsh_2016T,is it possible that a hundred years from now people will think that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood and bone marrow is today <unk>
1217_AbigailMarsh_2016T,maybe
1218_AbigailMarsh_2016T,so what 's at the root of all these amazing changes
1219_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> in part it seems to be
1220_AbigailMarsh_2016T,increases in wealth and standards of living <unk>
1221_AbigailMarsh_2016T,as societies become wealthier and better off people seem to turn their focus of attention outward
1222_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and as a result all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases from volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations
1223_AbigailMarsh_2016T,but
1224_AbigailMarsh_2016T,all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result <unk> which is that even as the world is becoming a better
1225_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> more humane place which it is there 's a very common perception that it 's becoming worse and more cruel <unk> which it 's not
1226_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and i don 't know exactly why this is but i think it may be that we now just know so much more about the suffering of strangers in distant places <unk>
1227_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and so we now care a lot more
1228_AbigailMarsh_2016T,about the suffering
1229_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> those distant strangers <unk> but what 's clear is the kinds of changes we 're seeing show
1230_AbigailMarsh_2016T,that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence maybe even more so
1231_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and while some people do seem to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others <unk>
1232_AbigailMarsh_2016T,i really believe that the ability to remove oneself from the center of the circle
1233_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and expand the circle
1234_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> of compassion outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone <unk> thank you
1235_AbigailMarsh_2016T,<unk> if you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the vermont state house where i was a lobbyist in training
1236_AbigailMarsh_2016T,and asked me what i was going to do with my life i would have told you that i 'd just passed the
1237_AbigailWashburn_2012U,<unk> the chinese equivalency exam and i was going to go study law in beijing <unk>
1238_AbigailWashburn_2012U,and i was going to improve u s china relations through top down policy changes and judicial system reforms
1239_AbigailWashburn_2012U,i had a plan
1240_AbigailWashburn_2012U,and i never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo
1241_AbigailWashburn_2012U,<unk> little did i know what a huge impact it would have on me one night
1242_AbigailWashburn_2012U,when i was at a party and i heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room and it was it was doc watson singing and playing shady grove
1243_AbigailWashburn_2012U,<unk> that sound was just so
1244_AbigailWashburn_2012U,beautiful the sound of doc 's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo and after being
1245_AbigailWashburn_2012U,totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness
1246_AbigailWashburn_2012U,and history of chinese culture it was like this total relief to hear something so truly

1248_AbigailWashburn_2012U,so before going to law school in china i bought a banjo i threw it in my little red truck and i

1311_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in
1312_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and a woman comes in with a child <unk> and conan doyle describes the following exchange the woman says good morning
1313_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,bell says what sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from burntisland
1314_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,she says it was good and he says what did you do with the other child she says i left him with my sister at leith
1315_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and he says and did you take the shortcut down inverleith row to get here to the infirmary
1316_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,she says i did and he says would you still be working at the linoleum factory and she says i am
1317_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and bell then goes on to explain to the students he says you see when she said ' good morning ' i picked up her fife accent and the nearest ferry crossing from fife is from burntisland
1318_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> she must have taken the ferry over
1319_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,you notice that the coat she 's carrying is too small for the child who is with her and therefore she started out the journey with two children but dropped one off along the way
1320_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,you notice the clay on the soles of her feet <unk> such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of edinburgh <unk> except in the
1321_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> and therefore she took a short cut down inverleith row to arrive here and finally <unk> she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland
1322_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and when bell actually strips the patient begins to examine the patient <unk> you can only imagine how much more he would discern <unk> and as a teacher of medicine as a student myself i was so inspired by that story <unk>
1323_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,but you might not realize that our ability to look
1324_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,into the body in this simple way <unk> using our senses is quite recent <unk> the picture i 'm showing you is of leopold auenbrugger
1325_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,who in the late 1700s discovered percussion <unk>
1326_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and the story is that leopold auenbrugger was the son of an innkeeper <unk>
1327_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and his father used to go down into the basement to tap on the sides of casks of wine to determine how much wine
1328_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> was left and whether to reorder <unk> and so when auenbrugger became a physician he
1329_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,began to do the same thing he began to tap on the chests of his patients on their abdomens and basically everything we know about percussion which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day
1330_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,organ enlargement fluid around the heart fluid in the lungs <unk> abdominal changes all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript
1331_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> novum new invention which would have disappeared into obscurity <unk> except for the fact that this physician corvisart a famous french physician
1332_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,famous only because he was physician to this gentleman
1333_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,corvisart repopularized and reintroduced the work <unk> and it was followed a year or two later by laennec discovering
1334_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> the stethoscope
1335_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,laennec it is said was walking in the streets of paris and saw two children playing with a stick one was scratching at the end of the stick another child listened at the other end <unk> and <unk>
1336_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called the cylinder later he renamed it the stethoscope
1337_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis if you 'll recall prior to that time no matter what ailed you you went to see the barber surgeon <unk>
1338_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> who wound up cupping you bleeding you purging you and oh yes if you wanted he would give you a haircut short on the sides long in the back and pull your tooth
1339_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> he made no attempt at diagnosis in fact some of you might well know
1340_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,that the barber pole the red and white stripes represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected
1341_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,but the arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body <unk>
1342_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and this particular painting <unk> i think represents the pinnacle the peak of that
1343_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> clinical era this is a very famous painting the doctor by luke fildes
1344_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,luke fildes was commissioned to paint this by tate who then established the tate gallery <unk> and tate asked fildes to paint a painting of social importance <unk> and it 's interesting that fildes picked this topic fildes

1349_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> what would fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era in the year two thousand and eleven would he have substituted

1352_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,i 've gotten into some trouble in silicon valley for saying that the patient in the bed has almost become an icon for the real patient who 's in the computer <unk>

1354_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> the ipatient is getting wonderful care all across america the real patient often wonders where is everyone
1355_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,when are they going to come by and explain things to me who 's in charge
1356_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,there 's a real disjunction between the patient 's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care
1357_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,i want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like
1358_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,when when i was in training <unk> the focus was
1359_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> was around the patient <unk> we went from bed to bed the attending physician was in charge <unk>
1360_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,too often these days rounds look very much like this where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient <unk>
1361_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,the discussion is all about images on the computer data <unk> and the one critical piece missing is that of the patient <unk>
1362_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,now i 've been influenced in this thinking
1363_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,by two anecdotes that i want to share with
1364_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer
1365_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,had a small breast cancer detected had her lumpectomy in the town in which i lived this is when i was in texas <unk> and she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care
1366_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and she found the place and decided to go there went there <unk> which is why i was surprised a few months
1367_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> later to see her back in our own town getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist and i pressed her and i asked her why did you
1368_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,come back and get your care here and she was reluctant to tell me she said the cancer center was wonderful it had a
1369_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,beautiful facility giant atrium valet parking a piano that played itself a concierge that took you around from here to there
1370_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,but she said but
1371_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,they did not touch my breasts
1372_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,now you and i could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts they had her scanned inside out they understood her breast cancer at the molecular level they had no need to touch her breasts but
1373_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,to her it mattered
1374_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> it was enough for her to make the decision to get her subsequent care with her private oncologist who <unk> every time she went <unk> examined both breasts including <unk>
1375_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> the axillary tail <unk> examined her axilla carefully <unk> examined her cervical region her inguinal region did a thorough exam and to her that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed
1376_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> stanford i had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue
1377_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,this is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy <unk>
1378_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,i say that because these are difficult patients they have often been rejected by their families have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who 's about to
1379_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> disappoint them <unk> and i learned very early on with my first patient
1380_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,that i could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of forty five minutes there was just no way <unk>
1381_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and if i tried i 'd disappoint them <unk>
1382_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and so
1383_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,i hit on this method where i invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit
1384_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> tried not to interrupt them
1385_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,we know the average american physician interrupts their patient in fourteen seconds <unk>
1386_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and if i ever get to heaven <unk> it will be because i held my piece for forty five minutes and did not interrupt my patient <unk>
1387_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,i then scheduled the physical exam for two weeks hence <unk> and when the patient came for the physical
1388_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,i was able to do a thorough physical because i had nothing else to do <unk> i like to think that i do
1389_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> a thorough physical exam <unk> but because the whole visit was now about the physical <unk> i could do an extraordinarily thorough exam <unk>
1390_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and i remember my very first patient in that series
1391_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,continued to tell me more history during what was meant to be the physical exam visit <unk>
1392_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and i began my ritual i always begin with the pulse then i examine the hands then i look at the nail beds then i slide my hand up to

1394_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and i remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and i had slipped back into a primitive ritual
1395_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,in which i had a role and the patient had a role and when i was done the patient said to me with some awe i have never been
1396_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> examined like this before now if that were true it 's a true condemnation
1397_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,of our health care system because they had been seen in other places <unk> i then proceeded to tell the patient <unk> once the patient was dressed
1398_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions which is this is not in your head

1402_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and i always felt that if
1403_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,my patient gave up the quest for the magic doctor <unk> the magic
1404_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> and began with me on a course towards wellness it was because i had earned the right
1405_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,to tell them these things by virtue of the examination something of importance had transpired in the exchange <unk>
1406_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,i took this to my colleagues at stanford in anthropology
1407_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and told them the same story <unk>
1408_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,and they immediately said to me well you are describing a classic ritual and they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation <unk>

1416_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,<unk> if you shortchange that ritual
1417_AbrahamVerghese_2011G,by not undressing the patient by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown by not doing a complete exam you have bypassed on the opportunity

1457_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,it was shortly after i had relocated from the us to nigeria i 'd quit my job in corporate america

1461_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,<unk> it was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth
1462_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,and i was really pained by what i saw because i thought to myself
1463_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,these poor fisherfolk how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions
1464_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,and then i thought there 's got to be a better way a win win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the
1465_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,<unk> cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed
1466_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,that i would say was my spark moment <unk>
1467_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,and so i did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed
1468_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,<unk> out of the several one struck me the most it was the use of the plant for handicrafts <unk> and i thought what a great idea
1469_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,personally i love handicrafts <unk> especially handicrafts that are woven around a story <unk>
1470_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,and so i thought this could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills
1471_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,and i thought to myself three simple steps to a mega solution
1472_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,<unk> first step
1473_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth that way you create access <unk> secondly you dry the water hyacinth stems <unk> and thirdly you weave

1475_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,<unk> a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts <unk> and so i began my quest to find out how i can learn how to weave
1476_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,and this quest took me to a community in ibadan where i lived called sabo sabo translates to strangers ' quarters
1477_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,and the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country so i literally took my dried weeds in hand there were several more of them and went knocking from door to door
1478_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes <unk> and i was directed to the shed of malam yahaya
1479_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,the problem though is that malam yahaya doesn 't speak english and neither did i speak hausa <unk>
1480_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,but some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate and that began my journey of learning how to weave

1489_AchenyoIdachaba_2015W,and help them to transform their adversity into prosperity so taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold

1504_AdamDavidson_2012S,and at every moment different partisans saying oh my god the economy 's about to collapse and the rest of us just going about spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy
1505_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> to give you a quick primer on where we are a quick refresher on where we are so the fiscal cliff
1506_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> i was told that that 's too partisan a thing to say although i can 't remember which party it 's supporting or attacking people say we should call it the
1507_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> fiscal slope or we should call it an austerity crisis but then other people say no that 's even more partisan so i just call it the <unk>
1508_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem <unk> and
1509_AdamDavidson_2012S,this is what the inevitable problem looks like so this is a projection of u s debt as a percentage of our overall economy of gdp
1510_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> dotted line represents the congressional budget office 's best guess of what will happen if congress really doesn 't do anything <unk> and as you can see sometime around <unk>
1511_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> we reach greek levels of debt somewhere around one hundred and thirty percent of gdp <unk>
1512_AdamDavidson_2012S,which tells you that some time in the next twenty years if congress does absolutely nothing we 're going to hit a moment where the world
1513_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> 's investors the world 's bond buyers are going to say we don 't trust america anymore we 're not going to lend them any money <unk> except at really high interest rates and at that moment our economy collapses <unk>
1514_AdamDavidson_2012S,but remember greece is there today we 're there in twenty years we have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis
1515_AdamDavidson_2012S,here 's another way to look at exactly the same problem <unk> the dark blue line is how much the government spends the light blue line is how much the government gets in and as you can see for most of recent history except for a brief period we
1516_AdamDavidson_2012S,have consistently spent more than we take in thus the national debt <unk> but as you can also see <unk> projected going forward the gap widens
1517_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> a bit and raises a bit and this graph is only through two thousand and twenty one it gets really really ugly out towards two thousand and thirty <unk>
1518_AdamDavidson_2012S,and this graph sort of sums up what the problem is the democrats <unk> they say well this isn 't a big deal we can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap especially if we raise
1519_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> got a better idea why don 't we lower both lines why don 't we lower government spending and lower government taxes and then we 'll be on an even more favorable <unk>
1520_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> long term deficit trajectory
1521_AdamDavidson_2012S,and behind this powerful disagreement between how to close that gap there 's the worst kind of cynical party politics
1522_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> the worst kind of insider
1523_AdamDavidson_2012S,baseball lobbying all of that stuff but there 's also this powerfully interesting <unk> respectful disagreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophies <unk>
1524_AdamDavidson_2012S,and
1525_AdamDavidson_2012S,i like to think when i picture how republicans see the economy what i picture is just some amazingly
1526_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> made in germany or japan <unk> but this amazing machine that 's constantly scouring every
1527_AdamDavidson_2012S,bit of human endeavor and taking
1528_AdamDavidson_2012S,resources money labor capital machinery away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts and while this might cause temporary dislocation what it does is it
1529_AdamDavidson_2012S,builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and
1530_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> die and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient so much richer for everybody <unk> and
1531_AdamDavidson_2012S,this view generally believes that there is a role for government a small role to set the rules so people aren 't lying and cheating and hurting each other maybe
1532_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> you know have a police force and a fire department and an army <unk> but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery <unk>
1533_AdamDavidson_2012S,and when i
1534_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> picture how democrats and <unk>
1535_AdamDavidson_2012S,economists picture this economy <unk> most democratic economists are you know they 're capitalists they believe yes that 's a good system a lot of the time it 's good to let markets move <unk>
1536_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> resources to their more productive use <unk> but that system has tons of problems
1537_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> called unproductive that 's not going to create an equitable fair society that machine doesn 't care about the environment about racism about all these issues that make this life <unk>
1538_AdamDavidson_2012S,worse for all of us and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses or from richer sources <unk> and give them to other sources
1539_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> when you think about the economy through these two different lenses
1540_AdamDavidson_2012S,you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve <unk> because the worse the crisis gets the higher the stakes are the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything
1541_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> and i can get really despairing i 've spent a lot of the last few years really depressed
1542_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> i learned something that i felt really excited about i feel like it 's really good news <unk> and it 's so shocking i don 't like saying it because i think people won 't believe me
1543_AdamDavidson_2012S,but here 's what i learned the american people taken as a whole when it comes to these issues to fiscal issues
1544_AdamDavidson_2012S,are moderate <unk> pragmatic centrists <unk> and i know that 's hard to believe that the american people are
1545_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> let me explain what i 'm thinking <unk> when you look at how the federal government spends money so this is the battle right here
1546_AdamDavidson_2012S,fifty five percent more than half is on social security medicare medicaid a few other health programs twenty percent defense nineteen percent discretionary <unk>
1547_AdamDavidson_2012S,and six percent interest so
1548_AdamDavidson_2012S,when we 're talking about cutting government spending this is the pie we 're talking about and americans overwhelmingly and it doesn 't matter
1549_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> matter what party they 're in
1550_AdamDavidson_2012S,overwhelmingly like that big fifty five percent chunk <unk> they like social security <unk> they like medicare they even like medicaid even though that goes to the poor and indigent which you might think would have less support <unk>
1551_AdamDavidson_2012S,and they do not want it fundamentally touched although the american people are remarkably comfortable
1552_AdamDavidson_2012S,and democrats roughly equal to republicans
1553_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable social security is fairly easy to fix the rumors of its demise are always greatly <unk>
1554_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> exaggerated so gradually raise social security retirement age maybe only on people not yet born
1555_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> just reduce it
1556_AdamDavidson_2012S,people generally
1557_AdamDavidson_2012S,are comfortable with it democrats and republicans
1558_AdamDavidson_2012S,raise medical health care contributions everyone hates that equally but republicans and democrats hate that together <unk>
1559_AdamDavidson_2012S,and so what this tells me is when you look at
1560_AdamDavidson_2012S,the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal
1561_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> we are not a nation that that 's powerfully divided on the major major issue <unk> we 're comfortable with it needing some tweaks but we want to keep it we 're not open to a discussion of eliminating it <unk>
1562_AdamDavidson_2012S,now there is one issue that
1563_AdamDavidson_2012S,is is hyper partisan and where there is one party that is just spend spend spend we don 't care spend some more and that of course is
1564_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> republicans when it comes to military defense spending they way outweigh democrats the vast majority want to protect
1565_AdamDavidson_2012S,military defense spending that 's twenty percent of the budget
1566_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> and that presents a more difficult issue <unk> i should also note that the [ discretionary ] spending which is about nineteen percent of the budget that is democratic and <unk>
1567_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> republican issues so you do have welfare food stamps other programs that tend to be popular among democrats but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of department
1568_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> of interior inducements for
1569_AdamDavidson_2012S,oil drilling and other things which tend to be popular among republicans
1570_AdamDavidson_2012S,now when it comes to taxes there is more disagreement <unk> that 's a more partisan area <unk>
1571_AdamDavidson_2012S,you have democrats overwhelmingly supportive of raising the income tax on people who make two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year republicans
1572_AdamDavidson_2012S,sort of against it although if you break it out by income
1573_AdamDavidson_2012S,republicans who make less than seventy five thousand dollars a year like this idea so basically republicans who make more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year don 't want to be taxed
1574_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> raising taxes on investment income <unk> you also see about two thirds of democrats but only one third of republicans are comfortable with that idea <unk>
1575_AdamDavidson_2012S,this brings up a really
1576_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> which is that we tend in this country to talk about democrats and republicans and think there 's this little group over there called independents that 's what two percent
1577_AdamDavidson_2012S,if you add democrats you add republicans you 've got the american people <unk> but that is not the case at all <unk> and it has not been the case for for most of modern american history
1578_AdamDavidson_2012S,roughly a third of americans say that they are democrats around a quarter say that they are republicans a tiny little sliver call themselves
1579_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> libertarians or socialists or some other small third party and
1580_AdamDavidson_2012S,the largest block forty percent say they 're independents <unk>
1581_AdamDavidson_2012S,so most americans are not partisan
1582_AdamDavidson_2012S,and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between so even though we have tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues of democrats and republicans
1583_AdamDavidson_2012S,we have even more
1584_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> more overlap when you add in the independents
1585_AdamDavidson_2012S,now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues we get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment but on these fiscal issues these important fiscal issues <unk>
1586_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say <unk> and in fact there 's this other group of people who are not as divided as
1587_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> talk to a lot of economists and
1588_AdamDavidson_2012S,back in the ' 70s and ' 80s it was ugly being an economist you were in what they called the saltwater camp meaning harvard princeton mit <unk>
1589_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> stanford <unk> berkeley or you were in the freshwater camp university of chicago university of rochester
1590_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a keynesian liberal economist and these people didn 't go to each other 's weddings they snubbed each other at conferences it 's still ugly <unk>
1591_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> to this day <unk> but in my experience it is really really hard to find an economist under forty who still has that kind of way of seeing the world the vast majority of economists it is so uncool to call yourself an ideologue of
1592_AdamDavidson_2012S,either camp the phrase that you want if you 're a graduate student or a postdoc or you 're a professor a 38 year old economics professor is i 'm an empiricist i go by the data
1593_AdamDavidson_2012S,and the data is very clear <unk> none of these major theories have been completely successful the 20th century the last hundred years is riddled with disastrous examples <unk>
1594_AdamDavidson_2012S,of of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful awful job
1595_AdamDavidson_2012S,the
1596_AdamDavidson_2012S,the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty
1597_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> they still are an awfully arrogant group of people i will assure you but they 're now arrogant about their impartiality
1598_AdamDavidson_2012S,and they too see a tremendous range of of potential outcomes <unk>
1599_AdamDavidson_2012S,and this nonpartisanship is
1600_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> that has existed in secret in america for years and years and years i 've spent a lot of the fall
1601_AdamDavidson_2012S,talking to the three major organizations that survey american political attitudes <unk> pew research <unk> the
1602_AdamDavidson_2012S,university of chicago 's national opinion research center <unk> and the most important but the least known is the american national election studies group that is the world 's longest most respected poll of political attitudes they 've been doing it
1603_AdamDavidson_2012S,and forty eight and what they show consistently throughout is that
1604_AdamDavidson_2012S,it 's almost impossible to find americans who are consistent ideologically who consistently support no we mustn <unk>
1605_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> 't tax and we must limit the size of government or no we must encourage government to play a larger role in redistribution and correcting the
1606_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> the ills of capitalism those groups are very very small <unk> the vast majority of people they pick and choose they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument
1607_AdamDavidson_2012S,and that that part of it has not changed
1608_AdamDavidson_2012S,what has changed is how people respond to vague questions if you ask people vague questions like do you think there should be more government or less government
1609_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> government should
1610_AdamDavidson_2012S,especially if you use loaded language do you think the government should provide handouts or do you think the government should redistribute then you can see radical partisan change but when you get <unk>
1611_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> specific when you actually ask about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration people are remarkably centrist
1612_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> they 're remarkably open to compromise so what we have then when you think about the fiscal cliff don 't think of it as
1613_AdamDavidson_2012S,the american people fundamentally can 't stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate warring nations
1614_AdamDavidson_2012S,think of it as a tiny tiny number of ancient economists and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process and they 've captured the process through familiar ways
1615_AdamDavidson_2012S,a primary system which encourages that small group of people 's voices <unk> because that small group of people the people who answer all yeses or all noes <unk>
1616_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> on those ideological questions they might be small but every one of them has a blog every one of them has been on fox or msnbc in the last week

1618_AdamDavidson_2012S,gets me back to reminding myself that that we know this experience we know what it 's like to have
1619_AdamDavidson_2012S,these people on tv
1620_AdamDavidson_2012S,in congress yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don 't adopt their view completely <unk> because it 's happened about the dollar ever since there 's
1621_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> been a dollar <unk>
1622_AdamDavidson_2012S,we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton in one thousand nine hundred and thirteen we had this ugly battle over the federal reserve when it was created with vicious angry

1624_AdamDavidson_2012S,<unk> then everyone agreeing okay so long as we 're on the gold standard it should be okay the fed can 't mess it up so badly <unk> but then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international

1632_AdamDavidson_2012S,begin the process towards compromise we all instantly are better off
1633_AdamDavidson_2012S,the fear is that the world is watching the fear is that the longer we delay

1810_AdamFoss_2016,over the course of the internship i began to recognize people in the auditorium not because they were criminal masterminds

1844_AdamFoss_2016,was the right answer
1845_AdamFoss_2016,for the most part prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions regardless of our intent <unk>
1846_AdamFoss_2016,despite our broad discretion we learn to avoid risk at all cost rendering our discretion
1847_AdamFoss_2016,basically useless
1848_AdamFoss_2016,history has conditioned us to believe that somehow the criminal justice system brings about accountability and improves public safety despite evidence to the contrary <unk>
1849_AdamFoss_2016,we 're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins so prosecutors aren 't really incentivized to be creative at our case dispositions or to take risks on people we might not otherwise

1863_AdamFoss_2016,i did the same thing as everybody else i came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice but i never learned what justice was in my classes none of us do
1864_AdamFoss_2016,none of us
1865_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> and yet prosecutors are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system
1866_AdamFoss_2016,our power is virtually boundless in most cases not the judge not the police not the legislature not the mayor not the governor not the president can tell us how to prosecute our cases <unk>
1867_AdamFoss_2016,the decision to arraign christopher and give him a criminal record was
1868_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> i would choose whether to prosecute him for thirty felonies for one felony for a misdemeanor or at all
1869_AdamFoss_2016,i would choose whether to leverage christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial and ultimately i would be
1870_AdamFoss_2016,in a position to ask for christopher to go to jail
1871_AdamFoss_2016,these are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered <unk> and we are unaware

1878_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> was hugging me and thanking me
1879_AdamFoss_2016,you cared about me and you changed my life it
1880_AdamFoss_2016,was christopher
1881_AdamFoss_2016,see i never arraigned christopher he never faced a judge or a jail he never had a criminal record
1882_AdamFoss_2016,instead i worked with christopher first on being accountable for his actions <unk> and then putting him in a position where he wouldn 't

1884_AdamFoss_2016,christopher did community service he wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community
1885_AdamFoss_2016,he applied to college he obtained financial aid and he went on to graduate from
1886_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> after we finished hugging i looked at his name tag to learn that christopher was the manager of a large bank in boston christopher had accomplished and making a lot more money than me
1887_AdamFoss_2016,he had accomplished all of this in the six years since i had first seen him in roxbury court <unk>
1888_AdamFoss_2016,i can 't take credit for christopher 's journey to
1889_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> but i certainly did my part to keep him on the path
1890_AdamFoss_2016,there are thousands of christophers out there some locked in our jails and prisons we need thousands of prosecutors to recognize that
1891_AdamFoss_2016,and to protect them an employed christopher is better for public safety than a condemned one it 's a bigger win
1892_AdamFoss_2016,for all of us in retrospect the decision not to throw the book at christopher makes perfect sense <unk> when i saw
1893_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> him that first day in roxbury court i didn 't see a criminal standing there i saw myself a young person in need of intervention

1901_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> girl who was arrested for prostituting to survive on the streets needed a safe place to live and grow something we could help her with
1902_AdamFoss_2016,i even helped a young man who was so afraid of the older gang kids showing up after school that one morning instead of a lunchbox into his backpack he put a loaded 9 millimeter
1903_AdamFoss_2016,we would spend our time that we 'd normally take prepping our cases for months and months for trial down the road by coming

1906_AdamFoss_2016,how would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs
1907_AdamFoss_2016,why are we spending eighty billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing when we could take that money and reallocate it into education
1908_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> into mental health treatment into substance abuse treatment and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods
1909_AdamFoss_2016,so why should this matter to you well one we 're spending a lot of money
1910_AdamFoss_2016,our money
1911_AdamFoss_2016,it costs one hundred and nine thousand dollars in some states to lock up a teenager for a year with a sixty percent chance that that person will return to the very same system that
1912_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> a terrible
1913_AdamFoss_2016,return on investment
1914_AdamFoss_2016,number two it 's the right thing to do <unk>
1915_AdamFoss_2016,if prosecutors were a part of creating the problem it 's incumbent on us to create a solution and we can do that using other disciplines that have already done the data and research for us <unk>
1916_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> and number three your voice and your vote can make that happen the next time there 's a local district attorney 's election in your jurisdiction ask candidates these
1917_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> questions one what are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer
1918_AdamFoss_2016,two what data are you collecting and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it 's working and
1919_AdamFoss_2016,number three <unk> if it 's not working for everybody what are you doing to fix it if
1920_AdamFoss_2016,they can 't answer the questions <unk> they shouldn 't be doing the job
1921_AdamFoss_2016,each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk is a living breathing example
1922_AdamFoss_2016,of the power of opportunity of intervention of support and of love <unk>
1923_AdamFoss_2016,while each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline for whatever <unk>
1924_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> malfeasances you committed <unk> barely any of you needed a day in jail to make you the people that you are today some of the greatest minds on the planet <unk>
1925_AdamFoss_2016,every day thousands of times a day prosecutors around the united states wield power so great that it can bring about catastrophe as quickly as it can bring
1926_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> about opportunity intervention <unk> support and yes <unk> even love
1927_AdamFoss_2016,those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community and a strong community is a safe one <unk> if our communities are broken don 't let the lawyers that you elect fix them with outdated inefficient expensive methods demand more vote for the prosecutor
1928_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> 's helping people stay out of jail not putting them in demand better you deserve it your children deserve it the people who are tied up in the system deserve it but most of all the people that we are sworn to <unk>
1929_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> protect and do justice for demand it we must <unk> we must do better <unk>
1930_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> speaking up
1931_AdamFoss_2016,is hard to do <unk> i understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago when my wife and i became
1932_AdamFoss_2016,new parents <unk>
1933_AdamFoss_2016,<unk> it was an amazing moment it was exhilarating and elating but it was also scary and terrifying and it got particularly terrifying
1934_AdamGalinsky_2016X,when we got home from the hospital and we were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding <unk>
1935_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and we wanted to call
1936_AdamGalinsky_2016X,our pediatrician <unk> but we also didn 't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy neurotic
1937_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> so we worried <unk> and we waited <unk> when we got to the doctor 's office the next day she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated <unk>
1938_AdamGalinsky_2016X,our son is fine now and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her
1939_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but in that moment <unk> i should 've spoken up <unk> but i didn 't
1940_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but sometimes we speak up when we shouldn 't and i learned that over ten years ago when i let my twin brother down my twin brother
1941_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and for one of his first films he got an offer from a distribution company <unk>
1942_AdamGalinsky_2016X,he was excited and he was inclined to accept the offer <unk> but as a negotiations researcher <unk> i insisted he make a counteroffer <unk> and i helped him craft the perfect one
1943_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and it was perfect
1944_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> the company was so offended they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing <unk>
1945_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and i 've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up when they can assert themselves when they can push their interests when they can express an opinion
1946_AdamGalinsky_2016X,when they can make an ambitious ask <unk>
1947_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and
1948_AdamGalinsky_2016X,the range of stories are varied and diverse <unk> but they also make up a universal tapestry can i correct my boss when they make a
1949_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> mistake can i confront my coworker
1950_AdamGalinsky_2016X,who keeps stepping on my toes can i challenge my friend 's insensitive joke can i tell the person i love the most
1951_AdamGalinsky_2016X,my deepest insecurities <unk>
1952_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and through these experiences i 've come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior <unk> now <unk> sometimes
1953_AdamGalinsky_2016X,we 're too strong we push ourselves too much
1954_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> 's what happened with my brother even making
1955_AdamGalinsky_2016X,an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior <unk> but sometimes we 're too weak <unk> that 's what happened with my wife and <unk> i
1956_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and this range of acceptable behaviors when we stay within our range <unk> we 're rewarded <unk> when we step outside that range <unk> we get punished in a variety of ways we get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized or we lose that raise or that promotion
1957_AdamGalinsky_2016X,or that deal <unk> now <unk> the first thing we need to know is what is my range <unk> but
1958_AdamGalinsky_2016X,the key thing is our range isn 't fixed
1959_AdamGalinsky_2016X,it 's actually pretty dynamic <unk> it expands
1960_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and it narrows based on the context and there 's one thing that determines that range more than anything else <unk>
1961_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and that 's your power <unk> your power determines your range
1962_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> what is power <unk> power comes in lots of forms in negotiations it comes in the form of alternatives <unk>
1963_AdamGalinsky_2016X,so my brother had no alternatives <unk> he lacked power <unk> the company had lots of alternatives <unk> they had power sometimes it 's being new to a country like an immigrant or new to <unk>
1964_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> an organization or new to an experience like my wife and i as new parents <unk> sometimes it 's at work where someone 's the boss and someone 's the subordinate
1965_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> sometimes it 's in relationships where one person 's more invested than the other person
1966_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and the key thing is is that when we have lots of power <unk> our range is very wide we have a lot of leeway in how to behave <unk>
1967_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but when we lack power <unk> our range narrows <unk> we have very little leeway <unk>
1968_AdamGalinsky_2016X,the problem is
1969_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> double bind happens when if we don 't speak up we go unnoticed <unk>
1970_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but if we do speak up <unk> we get punished <unk>
1971_AdamGalinsky_2016X,now many of you have heard the phrase the double bind and connected it with one thing and that 's gender the gender double bind is women who don 't speak up go unnoticed
1972_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> and women who do speak up get punished <unk> and the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up <unk>
1973_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but they have barriers to doing so
1974_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but what my research has shown over the last two decades is is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind <unk>
1975_AdamGalinsky_2016X,it 's a really a low power double bind <unk> and what looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise
1976_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> and a woman or men and women <unk> and think biological cause there 's something fundamentally different about the sexes
1977_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but in study after study i 've found that a better explanation for many sex differences
1978_AdamGalinsky_2016X,is really power <unk> and so it 's the
1979_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> lack power we have a narrow range and our double bind is very large
1980_AdamGalinsky_2016X,so we need to find ways to expand our range and over the last couple decades my colleagues and i have found two things really matter <unk>
1981_AdamGalinsky_2016X,the first you seem seem powerful in your own eyes the second you seem powerful in the eyes of others <unk> when i
1982_AdamGalinsky_2016X,i feel powerful
1983_AdamGalinsky_2016X,i feel confident not fearful i expand my own range <unk> when other people see me as powerful
1984_AdamGalinsky_2016X,they grant me a wider range <unk> so we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior and i 'm going to give you a set of tools today <unk>
1985_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> speaking up is risky <unk>
1986_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up
1987_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> the first
1988_AdamGalinsky_2016X,tool i 'm going to give you
1989_AdamGalinsky_2016X,got discovered in negotiations in an important finding
1990_AdamGalinsky_2016X,on average women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table
1991_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but hannah riley bowles and emily amanatullah have discovered there 's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious
1992_AdamGalinsky_2016X,that 's when they
1993_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> when they advocate for others <unk> they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind they become more assertive <unk> this is sometimes called the mama bear effect
1994_AdamGalinsky_2016X,like a mama bear defending her cubs when we advocate for others we can discover our own voice <unk>
1995_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but sometimes we have to advocate for ourselves
1996_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> how do we do that one of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective taking and <unk>
1997_AdamGalinsky_2016X,is really simple it 's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person <unk>
1998_AdamGalinsky_2016X,it 's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range <unk> when i take your perspective <unk> and i think about what you really want you 're more likely to give me what i really want <unk>
1999_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but here 's the problem
2000_AdamGalinsky_2016X,is hard to do so let 's do a little experiment <unk> i want you all to hold your hand just like this your finger put it up
2001_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and i want you to draw a capital letter e on your forehead as quickly as possible <unk>
2002_AdamGalinsky_2016X,ok <unk> it turns out that we can draw this e in one of two
2003_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> this was originally designed as a test of perspective taking i 'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an e on their forehead my former student erika hall
2004_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and you can see over here that 's the correct e i drew the e so it looks like an e to another person that 's the <unk> perspective taking e because it looks like an e from someone else 's vantage point but this e over here
2005_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> crisis <unk> i want to tell you about a particular crisis a man walks into a bank in watsonville california <unk>
2006_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and he says give me $ two thousand or i 'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb
2007_AdamGalinsky_2016X,now the bank manager didn 't give him the money <unk> she took a step back she took his perspective <unk> and she noticed something really important
2008_AdamGalinsky_2016X,he asked for a specific amount of money <unk> so she said
2009_AdamGalinsky_2016X,why did you ask for $ two thousand and he said my friend is going to be evicted unless i get him $ two thousand immediately and she said oh
2010_AdamGalinsky_2016X,you don 't want to rob the bank you want to take out a loan
2011_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> someone 's perspective it allows us to be ambitious and assertive but still be likable
2012_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> here 's another way to be assertive but still be likable <unk> and that is to signal flexibility
2013_AdamGalinsky_2016X,now <unk> imagine you 're a car salesperson <unk> and you want to sell someone a car you 're going to more likely make the sale if you give them
2014_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> my research shows that when you give people a choice among options <unk> it lowers their defenses and they 're more likely to accept your offer
2015_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and this doesn 't just work with salespeople it works with parents <unk> when my niece was four <unk> she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything <unk>
2016_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but then my sister in law had a brilliant idea
2017_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> what if i gave my my daughter a choice this shirt or that shirt <unk> ok that shirt this pant or that pant ok <unk> that pant <unk> and it worked brilliantly she got dressed quickly and without resistance when
2018_AdamGalinsky_2016X,i 've asked the question around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up <unk> the number one answer is when i have social support in my
2019_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> so we want to get allies on our side how do we do that well
2020_AdamGalinsky_2016X,one of the ways is be a mama bear when we advocate for others we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others <unk> but we also earn strong allies <unk>
2021_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> another way we can earn strong allies <unk> especially in high places is by asking other people for advice <unk>
2022_AdamGalinsky_2016X,when we ask others for advice
2023_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> like us because we flatter them <unk> and we 're expressing humility <unk> and this really works to solve another double bind <unk> and that 's the <unk>
2024_AdamGalinsky_2016X,the self promotion double bind is that if we don 't advertise our accomplishments <unk> no one notices <unk> and if we do we 're not likable <unk> but if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments we
2025_AdamGalinsky_2016X,are able to be competent in their
2026_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> eyes but also be likeable and this is so powerful
2027_AdamGalinsky_2016X,it even works when you see it coming there
2028_AdamGalinsky_2016X,have been multiple times in life when i have been forewarned that a low power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice
2029_AdamGalinsky_2016X,i want you to notice three things about this first i knew they were going to come ask me for advice two
2030_AdamGalinsky_2016X,'ve actually done research on the
2031_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> strategic benefits of asking for advice <unk> and three <unk> it still worked <unk>
2032_AdamGalinsky_2016X,i took their perspective i became more invested in their cause i became more committed to them because they asked for advice <unk>
2033_AdamGalinsky_2016X,now <unk> another time we feel more confident speaking up
2034_AdamGalinsky_2016X,is when we have expertise expertise gives us credibility <unk> when we have high power <unk> we already have credibility we
2035_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> only need good evidence
2036_AdamGalinsky_2016X,when we lack power <unk>
2037_AdamGalinsky_2016X,we don 't have the credibility <unk> we need excellent evidence
2038_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion <unk>
2039_AdamGalinsky_2016X,i want everyone
2040_AdamGalinsky_2016X,in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them i want you to describe a passion of yours to me i 've had people do this all over the world
2041_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and i asked them what did you notice about the other person when they described their passion and the answers are always the same their eyes lit up and got big they smiled <unk>
2042_AdamGalinsky_2016X,a big beaming smile they used their hands all over i had to duck because their hands were coming at me
2043_AdamGalinsky_2016X,as you listened to their passion
2044_AdamGalinsky_2016X,they said my eyes lit up <unk> i smiled i leaned in
2045_AdamGalinsky_2016X,when we tap into our passion <unk> we give ourselves the courage in our own eyes to speak up <unk> but we also get the permission from others to speak up
2046_AdamGalinsky_2016X,tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak <unk> both men and women get punished
2047_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> at work when they shed tears
2048_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but lizzie wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion <unk> the condemnation of our crying
2049_AdamGalinsky_2016X,disappears for both men and women i want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother 's wedding
2050_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> my dad was a psychologist like me but his real love and his real passion was cinema like my brother <unk> and so he wrote a speech for my brother 's wedding
2051_AdamGalinsky_2016X,about the roles we play in the human comedy <unk>
2052_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and he said the lighter your touch <unk> the better you become at improving and enriching your performance those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance
2053_AdamGalinsky_2016X,grow change
2054_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and expand the self play it well <unk> and your days will be mostly joyful
2055_AdamGalinsky_2016X,what my dad was saying is that we 've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world <unk>
2056_AdamGalinsky_2016X,but he was also saying the essence of this talk <unk>
2057_AdamGalinsky_2016X,those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and
2058_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> so when a scene calls for it be a ferocious mama bear
2059_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and a humble advice seeker have excellent evidence and strong
2060_AdamGalinsky_2016X,allies be a passionate perspective taker <unk> and if you use those tools and each and every one of you can use these tools
2061_AdamGalinsky_2016X,you will expand your range of acceptable behavior <unk> and your days will be mostly joyful <unk> thank you
2062_AdamGalinsky_2016X,<unk> i think the beautiful malin [ akerman ] put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury <unk>

2065_AdamGalinsky_2016X,and how through that journey <unk> we 've redefined charity <unk>
2066_AdamGarone_2011X,we 're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world
2067_AdamGarone_2011X,and i hope <unk> through that process
2068_AdamGarone_2011X,that i inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place
2069_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> the most common question i get asked and i 'm going to answer it now so i don 't have to do it over drinks tonight <unk> is how did this come about how did movember <unk>
2070_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause <unk> they then go on to create an event <unk> and beyond that a foundation to support
2071_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> pretty much in every case that 's how a charity
2072_AdamGarone_2011X,starts
2073_AdamGarone_2011X,not so with movember
2074_AdamGarone_2011X,movember started in a very traditional australian way it was on a sunday afternoon i was with my brother and a mate having a few beers <unk> and i was watching the world go by had
2075_AdamGarone_2011X,a few more beers and the conversation turned to ' 70s fashion
2076_AdamGarone_2011X,and how everything manages to come back into style <unk> and a few more beers i said there has to be some stuff that hasn 't come back
2077_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> back
2078_AdamGarone_2011X,then one more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache <unk> why hasn 't that made a comeback
2079_AdamGarone_2011X,so then there was a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back
2080_AdamGarone_2011X,so in australia mo
2081_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> is slang for mustache <unk> so we renamed the month of november movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today <unk> and they are start the month <unk>
2082_AdamGarone_2011X,rock a mustache not a beard not a goatee a mustache for the thirty days of november <unk> and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache themed party
2083_AdamGarone_2011X,and award a prize for the best and of course the worst
2084_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> now trust me when you 're growing a mustache back in two thousand and three and there were thirty of us back then and this was before the ironic
2085_AdamGarone_2011X,hipster mustache movement
2086_AdamGarone_2011X,it created a lot of controversy
2087_AdamGarone_2011X,so my boss wouldn 't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who 's no longer my girlfriend
2088_AdamGarone_2011X,hated it parents would
2089_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> shuffle kids away from us
2090_AdamGarone_2011X,but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey <unk> and
2091_AdamGarone_2011X,we had a lot of fun and in two thousand and four i said to the guys that was so much fun <unk> we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year
2092_AdamGarone_2011X,we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer and
2093_AdamGarone_2011X,we thought you know what there 's nothing for men 's health <unk>
2094_AdamGarone_2011X,why is that <unk> <unk> why can 't we combine growing a mustache and doing something for men 's health and i started to research that topic <unk> and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed
2095_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> but there was nothing for this cause <unk> so we married growing a mustache
2096_AdamGarone_2011X,with prostate cancer
2097_AdamGarone_2011X,and then we created our tagline <unk> which is changing the face of men 's health and that eloquently describes the challenge changing your appearance for the thirty days and also the outcome that <unk>
2098_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> we 're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health <unk> having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face
2099_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> the ceo of the prostate cancer foundation i said to him i 've got the most amazing idea that 's going to transform your organization
2100_AdamGarone_2011X,laughter and i didn 't want to share with him the idea over the phone so i convinced him to meet with me for coffee in melbourne in two thousand and four <unk>
2101_AdamGarone_2011X,and we sat down and i shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across australia raising awareness for this cause <unk>
2102_AdamGarone_2011X,and funds for his organization and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that
2103_AdamGarone_2011X,i said we 're going to come together at the end we 're going to have a mustache themed party we 're going to have djs <unk> we 're going to celebrate life <unk> and we 're going to change the face of men 's health
2104_AdamGarone_2011X,and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he
2105_AdamGarone_2011X,said adam that 's a really novel idea <unk>
2106_AdamGarone_2011X,but we 're an ultraconservative organization <unk> we can 't have anything to do with you
2107_AdamGarone_2011X,so i paid for coffee that day
2108_AdamGarone_2011X,and
2109_AdamGarone_2011X,his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we 'll gladly take it
2110_AdamGarone_2011X,so my lesson that year was persistence <unk> and we persisted <unk> and we got four hundred and fifty
2111_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> and we donated every cent of that to the prostate cancer foundation of australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they 'd ever received <unk>
2112_AdamGarone_2011X,so from that day forward <unk> my life has become about a mustache <unk> every day this morning i wake up and go my life is about a mustache
2113_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> so in two thousand and five the campaign
2114_AdamGarone_2011X,got more momentum was more successful in australia and then new zealand <unk>
2115_AdamGarone_2011X,and then in two thousand and six we came to a pivotal point it was
2116_AdamGarone_2011X,consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends
2117_AdamGarone_2011X,that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level
2118_AdamGarone_2011X,it 's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches
2119_AdamGarone_2011X,let me tell you that there 's not too many people interested in
2120_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> not even the prostate cancer foundation <unk> who we 'd raised about one point two million dollars for at that stage
2121_AdamGarone_2011X,so again we persisted <unk> and foster 's brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever
2122_AdamGarone_2011X,sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job i did consulting on the side <unk> and leading into movember
2123_AdamGarone_2011X,two thousand and six we 'd run through all
2124_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> run through all the money i had and essentially we had no money left <unk> and we 'd convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies <unk> whatnot to delay their billing until december
2125_AdamGarone_2011X,so we 'd racked up at this stage about six hundred thousand dollars worth of
2126_AdamGarone_2011X,debt <unk> so if movember two thousand and six didn 't happen the four founders <unk> well <unk> we would 've been broke <unk> we would 've been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches
2127_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> you know what if that 's the worst thing that happens <unk> so what we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks
2128_AdamGarone_2011X,then in early two thousand and seven a really interesting thing happened
2129_AdamGarone_2011X,we had mo bros from from canada from the u s and from the u k emailing us and
2130_AdamGarone_2011X,calling us and saying hey there 's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries <unk>
2131_AdamGarone_2011X,so we thought why not let 's do it <unk>
2132_AdamGarone_2011X,so i cold called the ceo of prostate cancer canada <unk> and i said to him i have this most amazing concept it
2133_AdamGarone_2011X,'s going to transform your organization
2134_AdamGarone_2011X,i don 't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if i fly all the way to toronto so i flew here met down on front street east <unk> and we sat in the boardroom <unk> and i said
2135_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> vision
2136_AdamGarone_2011X,of getting men growing mustaches all across canada raising awareness and funds for your organization
2137_AdamGarone_2011X,and he looked at me and laughed and said adam <unk> sounds like a really novel idea but we 're an ultraconservative organization
2138_AdamGarone_2011X,i 've heard this before i know how it goes <unk>
2139_AdamGarone_2011X,but he said we will partner with you <unk> but we 're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work
2140_AdamGarone_2011X,so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country the u s and the u k and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely <unk>
2141_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> more money globally than we could just in australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure and we 're not about finding an australian cure or a canadian
2142_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> about finding the cure <unk>
2143_AdamGarone_2011X,so in two thousand and seven <unk> we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage
2144_AdamGarone_2011X,for the campaign it wasn 't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung ho with our success in australia
2145_AdamGarone_2011X,and new zealand at that stage <unk> so that year really taught us the importance of being patient
2146_AdamGarone_2011X,and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets
2147_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> but what i 'm really pleased to say is in two thousand and ten movember became a truly global movement canada was just pipped to the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world <unk>
2148_AdamGarone_2011X,last year we had four hundred and fifty thousand mo bros spread across the world and together we raised
2149_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> and that makes movember now the biggest funder of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world <unk>
2150_AdamGarone_2011X,and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches
2151_AdamGarone_2011X,laughter and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon
2152_AdamGarone_2011X,our ambassadors are the mo bros and
2153_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> the mo sistas and i think that 's been fundamental to our success <unk>
2154_AdamGarone_2011X,we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way <unk>
2155_AdamGarone_2011X,so now i live in in los angeles because the prostate cancer foundation of the u s is based there <unk> and i always get asked by the media down there because
2156_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> single person every single mo bro and mo sista that participates in movember is our celebrity ambassador <unk> and that is so so important and fundamental to our success
2157_AdamGarone_2011X,now what i want
2158_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> share with you is
2159_AdamGarone_2011X,one of my most touching
2160_AdamGarone_2011X,movember moments <unk> and it happened here in toronto last year at the end of the campaign
2161_AdamGarone_2011X,i was out with a team it was the end of movember we 'd had a great campaign and to be honest we 'd had our fair share of beer that night <unk> but i said you know what i think we 've got one more bar left in us
2162_AdamGarone_2011X,so we piled into a
2163_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> i know it 's about men 's health i know it 's about prostate cancer <unk> but this is for breast cancer and i said
2164_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka <unk> because we couldn 't afford proper treatment for her and he said
2165_AdamGarone_2011X,this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi <unk>
2166_AdamGarone_2011X,and i didn 't tell him who i was because i didn 't think it was appropriate and i just shook his hand and i said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache
2167_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> having a joke
2168_AdamGarone_2011X,it 's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way <unk> and being significant in their own life
2169_AdamGarone_2011X,for us now at movember <unk>
2170_AdamGarone_2011X,we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact <unk>
2171_AdamGarone_2011X,awareness and education <unk>
2172_AdamGarone_2011X,survivor support programs and research
2173_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> now we always focus naturally on how much we raise because it 's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education
2174_AdamGarone_2011X,is more important than the funds we raise because i know that is changing and saving lives today and it 's probably best exampled
2175_AdamGarone_2011X,by a young guy that i met at south by southwest in austin texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember
2176_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> but i went home for thanksgiving dinner <unk> and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on
2177_AdamGarone_2011X,and we talked i talked to them about movember <unk> and then after that my dad
2178_AdamGarone_2011X,came up to me and at the age of <unk>
2179_AdamGarone_2011X,for the first time ever i had a conversation with my dad one on one about men 's health <unk> i had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer and i learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer
2180_AdamGarone_2011X,and i was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn 't know that <unk> and he hadn 't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate
2181_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> so those conversations getting men engaged in this at
2182_AdamGarone_2011X,whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise
2183_AdamGarone_2011X,now to the funds we raise <unk> and research and how we 're redefining research
2184_AdamGarone_2011X,we fund prostate cancer foundations now in thirteen countries <unk>
2185_AdamGarone_2011X,we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently
2186_AdamGarone_2011X,we realized there 's a real lack of collaboration going on
2187_AdamGarone_2011X,even within institutions let alone nationally let alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is cancer research the world over
2188_AdamGarone_2011X,and so we said right we 'd redefined charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that <unk>
2189_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> so what we did was we created a global action plan and we 're taking ten percent of what 's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund and
2190_AdamGarone_2011X,we 've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund <unk>
2191_AdamGarone_2011X,and they come together each year and identify the number one priority <unk>
2192_AdamGarone_2011X,and that <unk> last year was getting a better screening test <unk> so they identified that as a priority and then they 've got and recruited now three hundred researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially
2193_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> same topic <unk> so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate
2194_AdamGarone_2011X,and bringing them together <unk> and that 's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes <unk>
2195_AdamGarone_2011X,and that 's how we 're redefining
2196_AdamGarone_2011X,the research world <unk>
2197_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> what i know about my movember journey is that with a really creative idea
2198_AdamGarone_2011X,with passion with persistence <unk> and a lot of patience
2199_AdamGarone_2011X,four mates four mustaches can inspire a room full of people <unk> and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city <unk> and that city is melbourne my
2200_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> and that city can go on and inspire a state <unk> and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men 's health
2201_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> seven years ago a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company he said
2202_AdamGarone_2011X,i 'm working with three friends and we 're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online
2203_AdamGarone_2011X,and i said ok you guys spent the whole
2204_AdamGarone_2011X,<unk> we all took internships just in case it doesn 't work out all right but you 're going to go in full time once you graduate
2205_AdamGrant_2016,not exactly we 've all lined up backup jobs
2206_AdamGrant_2016,six months go by <unk> it 's the day before the company launches <unk> and there is still not a functioning website
2207_AdamGrant_2016,you guys realize the entire company is a website that 's literally all it is
2208_AdamGrant_2016,i obviously declined to invest and they ended up naming the company
2209_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> parker
2210_AdamGrant_2016,they sell glasses online <unk>
2211_AdamGrant_2016,they were recently recognized as the world 's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars <unk>
2212_AdamGrant_2016,and now my wife handles our investments <unk>
2213_AdamGrant_2016,why was i so wrong to find out i 've been studying people
2214_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them
2215_AdamGrant_2016,they are people who stand out and speak up originals drive creativity and change in the world <unk> they 're the people you want to bet on
2216_AdamGrant_2016,and they look nothing like i expected
2217_AdamGrant_2016,i want to show you today three things i 've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them
2218_AdamGrant_2016,so the first reason that i passed on
2219_AdamGrant_2016,warby parker was they were really slow getting off the ground <unk> now <unk> you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator <unk>
2220_AdamGrant_2016,well i have a confession for you i 'm the opposite <unk> i 'm a <unk>
2221_AdamGrant_2016,yes that 's an actual term you know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you haven 't done anything yet <unk>
2222_AdamGrant_2016,i just feel that a few months ahead of time
2223_AdamGrant_2016,so this started early when i was a kid <unk> i took nintendo games very seriously <unk>
2224_AdamGrant_2016,i would wake up at 5am start playing and not stop until i had mastered them
2225_AdamGrant_2016,eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of
2226_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> since then i have traded hair for teeth
2227_AdamGrant_2016,but this served me well in college because i finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline <unk>
2228_AdamGrant_2016,and i was proud of that
2229_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> until a few years ago <unk> i had a student named jihae who came to me
2230_AdamGrant_2016,and said i have my most creative ideas when i 'm procrastinating and i was like that 's cute where are the four papers you owe me
2231_AdamGrant_2016,no she was one of our most creative students and as an organizational psychologist this is the kind of idea that i test <unk>
2232_AdamGrant_2016,so i challenged her to get some data <unk> she goes into a bunch of companies she has people fill out
2233_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> surveys about how often they procrastinate then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are <unk>
2234_AdamGrant_2016,and sure enough the precrastinators like me who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately <unk>
2235_AdamGrant_2016,so i want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators <unk> she was like
2236_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> are our results
2237_AdamGrant_2016,you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don 't have any new ideas
2238_AdamGrant_2016,and on the flip side the people who race in
2239_AdamGrant_2016,are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don 't have original thoughts either there 's a sweet
2240_AdamGrant_2016,sweet spot where originals seem to live <unk>
2241_AdamGrant_2016,why is this <unk> maybe original people just have bad work habits <unk> maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity
2242_AdamGrant_2016,to find out
2243_AdamGrant_2016,we designed some experiments <unk> we asked people to generate new business ideas and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are
2244_AdamGrant_2016,and some of them are asked to do the task right away others we randomly assign to procrastinate
2245_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> minesweeper in front of them
2246_AdamGrant_2016,for either five or ten minutes <unk>
2247_AdamGrant_2016,and sure enough <unk> the moderate procrastinators are sixteen percent more creative than the other two groups
2248_AdamGrant_2016,now minesweeper is awesome but it 's not the driver of the effect <unk> because if you play the game first before you learn about the task there 's no creativity boost it
2249_AdamGrant_2016,'s only when you 're told that you 're going to be working on this problem <unk> and then you start procrastinating but the task
2250_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> is still active in the back of your mind
2251_AdamGrant_2016,that you start to incubate procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas to think in nonlinear ways to make unexpected leaps <unk>
2252_AdamGrant_2016,so just as we were finishing these experiments i was starting to write a book about originals and i thought this is the perfect time to teach myself to
2253_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> i woke up early the next morning and i made a to do list with steps on how to procrastinate
2254_AdamGrant_2016,laughter and then i worked diligently
2255_AdamGrant_2016,toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal i started writing the procrastination chapter and one day i
2256_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> was halfway through i literally put it away in <unk> mid sentence for months it was agony <unk>
2257_AdamGrant_2016,but when i came back to it i had all sorts of new ideas
2258_AdamGrant_2016,as aaron sorkin put it you call it procrastinating <unk> i call it thinking
2259_AdamGrant_2016,and along the way i discovered that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators <unk> take leonardo da vinci he
2260_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> toiled on and off for sixteen years on the mona lisa he felt like a failure he wrote as much in his journal <unk>
2261_AdamGrant_2016,but some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light
2262_AdamGrant_2016,and made him into a much better painter <unk> what about martin luther king jr the night before the biggest speech of his life the march on washington <unk> he was up past
2263_AdamGrant_2016,rewriting it he 's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage <unk> and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines
2264_AdamGrant_2016,when he gets onstage <unk> eleven minutes in he leaves his prepared remarks
2265_AdamGrant_2016,to utter four words that changed the course of history i have a dream that was not in the script
2266_AdamGrant_2016,by delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the
2267_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> very last minute <unk>
2268_AdamGrant_2016,he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas and because the text wasn 't set in stone <unk> he had freedom to improvise
2269_AdamGrant_2016,procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity <unk> but it can be a virtue for creativity <unk>
2270_AdamGrant_2016,what you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they 're slow to finish and this is what i missed with
2271_AdamGrant_2016,when they were dragging their heels for six months i looked at them and said you know a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online
2272_AdamGrant_2016,they missed the first mover advantage <unk>
2273_AdamGrant_2016,but what i didn 't realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online <unk>
2274_AdamGrant_2016,and it turns out the first mover advantage is mostly a myth
2275_AdamGrant_2016,look at a classic study of over fifty product categories
2276_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better
2277_AdamGrant_2016,what you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of forty seven percent compared with only eight percent
2278_AdamGrant_2016,for the improvers look at facebook waiting to build a social network until after myspace
2279_AdamGrant_2016,and friendster look at google waiting for years after altavista and yahoo
2280_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> 's much easier
2281_AdamGrant_2016,to improve on somebody else 's idea than it is to create something new from scratch
2282_AdamGrant_2016,so the lesson i learned is that to be original you don 't have to be first you just have to be different and better
2283_AdamGrant_2016,but that wasn 't the only reason i passed on warby parker <unk> they were also full of doubts they had backup plans
2284_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original because i expected that
2285_AdamGrant_2016,originals would look something like this
2286_AdamGrant_2016,now on the surface a lot of original people look confident but behind the scenes they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do
2287_AdamGrant_2016,they just manage it differently <unk>
2288_AdamGrant_2016,let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us
2289_AdamGrant_2016,laughter now in my research i discovered there are two different kinds of doubt there 's self doubt and idea
2290_AdamGrant_2016,doubt self doubt is paralyzing <unk>
2291_AdamGrant_2016,it leads you to freeze <unk> but idea doubt is energizing it motivates you to test to experiment to refine just like mlk did
2292_AdamGrant_2016,and so the key to being original
2293_AdamGrant_2016,is just a simple thing
2294_AdamGrant_2016,of avoiding the leap from step three to step four instead of saying i 'm crap you say the first few drafts are always crap <unk>
2295_AdamGrant_2016,and i 'm just not there yet
2296_AdamGrant_2016,so how do you get there well there 's a clue it turns out in the internet browser that you use we can predict your job performance and your commitment just by
2297_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> knowing what web browser you use <unk> now some of you are not going to like the results of this study
2298_AdamGrant_2016,but there is good evidence that firefox and chrome users significantly outperform internet explorer and safari users
2299_AdamGrant_2016,they also stay in their jobs fifteen percent longer by the way <unk> why it 's not a technical advantage
2300_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> the four browser groups on average have similar typing speed
2301_AdamGrant_2016,and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge it 's about how you got the browser
2302_AdamGrant_2016,because if you use internet explorer or safari those came preinstalled on your computer and you accepted the default option that was handed to you
2303_AdamGrant_2016,if you wanted firefox or chrome you had to doubt the default and ask is there a different option out there <unk> and then be a little resourceful and download a
2304_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> so people hear about this study and they 're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser
2305_AdamGrant_2016,no <unk> it 's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option
2306_AdamGrant_2016,and if you do that well <unk> you will open yourself up to the opposite of dj vu
2307_AdamGrant_2016,there 's a name for it it 's called vuja de laughter
2308_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> de is when you look at something you 've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes <unk>
2309_AdamGrant_2016,it 's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can 't get the green light for more than half a century
2310_AdamGrant_2016,in every past version <unk> the main character has been an evil queen <unk>
2311_AdamGrant_2016,but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense she rewrites the first act reinvents the villain as a tortured hero
2312_AdamGrant_2016,and frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever
2313_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> so there 's a simple message from this story when you feel doubt don 't let it go
2314_AdamGrant_2016,what about fear originals feel fear too
2315_AdamGrant_2016,they 're afraid of failing <unk> but what sets them apart from the rest of us is that they 're even more afraid of failing to try <unk>
2316_AdamGrant_2016,they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
2317_AdamGrant_2016,they know that in the long run our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions <unk>
2318_AdamGrant_2016,the things we wish we could redo if you look at the science are the chances not taken <unk>
2319_AdamGrant_2016,elon musk told me recently he didn 't expect tesla to succeed <unk> he was sure the first few spacex launches would fail to make it to orbit let alone
2320_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> but it was too important not to try <unk> and for so many of us when we have an important idea we don 't bother to try <unk>
2321_AdamGrant_2016,but i have some good news for you
2322_AdamGrant_2016,you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas a lot of people think they will if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion
2323_AdamGrant_2016,eighty five percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up
2324_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> they were afraid of embarrassing themselves of looking stupid <unk> but guess what originals have lots and lots of bad ideas <unk> tons of them in fact <unk>
2325_AdamGrant_2016,take the guy who invented this do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults <unk>
2326_AdamGrant_2016,you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb
2327_AdamGrant_2016,if you look across fields <unk> the greatest originals are the ones
2328_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> who fail the most because they 're the ones who try the most <unk> take classical composers the best of the best <unk> why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others
2329_AdamGrant_2016,and also have their compositions rerecorded more times one of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate <unk>
2330_AdamGrant_2016,the more output you churn out the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original
2331_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> even the three icons of classical music bach <unk> beethoven mozart
2332_AdamGrant_2016,had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions
2333_AdamGrant_2016,to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces <unk>
2334_AdamGrant_2016,now <unk> you may be wondering how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot <unk> i don 't know how wagner pulled that off <unk>
2335_AdamGrant_2016,but for most of us <unk> if we want to be more original we have to generate more
2336_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> ideas
2337_AdamGrant_2016,the <unk> warby parker founders <unk> when they were trying to name their company <unk>
2338_AdamGrant_2016,they needed something sophisticated unique with no negative associations to build a retail brand <unk>
2339_AdamGrant_2016,and they tested over two thousand possibilities before they finally put together warby and parker <unk>
2340_AdamGrant_2016,so if you put all this together what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us <unk> they feel fear and doubt
2341_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> procrastinate <unk> they have bad ideas and sometimes it 's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed <unk>
2342_AdamGrant_2016,so when you see those things don 't make the same mistake i did don 't write them off and when that 's you don 't count yourself out either
2343_AdamGrant_2016,know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity
2344_AdamGrant_2016,that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try
2345_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones
2346_AdamGrant_2016,look being original is not easy <unk> but i have no doubt about this <unk> it 's the best way to improve the world around us
2347_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> i want you to look around the room for a minute
2348_AdamGrant_2016,and try to find the most paranoid person here and then i want you to point at that person for me ok don
2349_AdamGrant_2016,'t actually do it
2350_AdamGrant_2016,<unk> as an organizational psychologist i spend a lot of time in workplaces <unk> and i find paranoia everywhere
2351_AdamGrant_2016,paranoia is caused by people that i call takers takers are self serving in their interactions it 's all about what can you do for me
2352_AdamGrant_2016,the opposite is a giver <unk> it 's somebody who approaches most interactions by asking what can i do for you
2353_AdamGrant_2016S,i wanted to give you a chance to think about your own style we all have moments of giving and taking your style
2354_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> this is the only thing i will say today that has no data behind it <unk> but i am convinced the longer it takes for you to laugh at this cartoon the more worried we should be that you 're a taker
2355_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> of course not all takers are narcissists some are just givers who got burned one too many times <unk> then there 's another kind of taker that we won 't be addressing today and that 's called a psychopath
2356_AdamGrant_2016S,i was curious though about how common these extremes are and so i surveyed over thirty thousand people across industries around the world 's cultures <unk> and i found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking <unk> they choose this third style called
2357_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> matching
2358_AdamGrant_2016S,if you 're a matcher you try to keep an even balance of give and take quid pro quo i 'll do something for you if you do something for me <unk>
2359_AdamGrant_2016S,and that seems like a safe way to live your life but is it the most effective and productive way to live your life
2360_AdamGrant_2016S,the answer to that question is a very definitive <unk> maybe
2361_AdamGrant_2016S,i studied dozens of organizations thousands of people i had engineers measuring their productivity
2362_AdamGrant_2016S,i looked at medical students ' grades even salespeople 's revenue
2363_AdamGrant_2016S,and unexpectedly the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers
2364_AdamGrant_2016S,the engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors than they got back <unk> they were so busy doing other people 's jobs they literally ran out of time and energy to get their own work completed
2365_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> school the lowest grades belong to the students who agree most strongly with statements like i love helping others
2366_AdamGrant_2016S,which suggests the doctor you ought to trust is the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody
2367_AdamGrant_2016S,and then in sales too the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople <unk>
2368_AdamGrant_2016S,i actually reached out to one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score <unk> and i asked him why do you suck at
2369_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> your job i didn 't ask it that way but what 's the cost of generosity in sales and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that
2370_AdamGrant_2016S,i would never sell them one of our crappy products
2371_AdamGrant_2016S,laughter so just out of curiosity how many of you self identify more as givers than takers or matchers raise your hands ok
2372_AdamGrant_2016S,it would have been more before we talked about these data
2373_AdamGrant_2016S,but
2374_AdamGrant_2016S,actually it turns out
2375_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> 's a twist here <unk> because givers are often sacrificing themselves <unk> but they make their organizations better we have a huge body of evidence
2376_AdamGrant_2016S,many many studies looking at the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team or an organization and the more often people are helping and sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring <unk>
2377_AdamGrant_2016S,the better organizations do on every metric we can measure <unk> higher profits customer satisfaction
2378_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> retention even lower operating expenses <unk> so givers spend a lot of time trying to help other people and improve the team <unk> and then unfortunately they suffer along the way <unk>
2379_AdamGrant_2016S,i want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers actually get to succeed <unk>
2380_AdamGrant_2016S,so i wondered then if givers are the worst performers who are the best performers
2381_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> let me start with the good news <unk> it 's not the takers takers tend to rise quickly but also fall quickly in most jobs <unk>
2382_AdamGrant_2016S,and they fall at the hands of matchers
2383_AdamGrant_2016S,if you 're a matcher you believe in an eye for an eye a just world <unk>
2384_AdamGrant_2016S,and so when you meet a taker you feel like it 's your mission in life to just punish the hell out of that person
2385_AdamGrant_2016S,and that way justice gets served well most people are matchers and that means if you 're a
2386_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> it tends to catch up with you eventually what goes around will come around <unk> and so the logical conclusion is it must be the matchers who are the best performers <unk>
2387_AdamGrant_2016S,but they 're not in every job in every organization i 've ever studied the best results belong to the givers again
2388_AdamGrant_2016S,take a look at some data i gathered from hundreds of salespeople tracking their revenue <unk>
2389_AdamGrant_2016S,what you can see is that the givers go to both extremes <unk> they make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue but also the highest revenue <unk> the same patterns were true for engineers ' productivity and
2390_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> students ' grades givers are overrepresented at the bottom and at the top of every success metric that i can track <unk>
2391_AdamGrant_2016S,which raises the question how do we create a world where more of these givers get to excel i want to talk about how to do that not just in businesses but also in nonprofits schools
2392_AdamGrant_2016S,even governments are you ready i was going to do it anyway but i appreciate the enthusiasm
2393_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> 's really critical is to recognize that givers are your most valuable people but if they 're not careful <unk> they burn out so
2394_AdamGrant_2016S,you have to protect the givers in your midst <unk> and i learned a great lesson about this from fortune 's best networker <unk>
2395_AdamGrant_2016S,it 's the guy not the cat
2396_AdamGrant_2016S,laughter his name is adam rifkin <unk> he 's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount of his time helping other people and his secret weapon
2397_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> is the five minute favor <unk>
2398_AdamGrant_2016S,adam said you don 't have to be mother teresa or gandhi to be a giver <unk> you just have to find small ways to add large value to other people 's lives
2399_AdamGrant_2016S,that could be as simple as making an introduction between two people who could benefit from knowing each other
2400_AdamGrant_2016S,it could be sharing your knowledge or giving a little bit of feedback or it might be even something as basic
2401_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> you know i 'm going to try and figure out if i can recognize somebody whose work has gone unnoticed
2402_AdamGrant_2016S,and those five minute favors are really critical to helping givers set boundaries and protect themselves
2403_AdamGrant_2016S,the second thing that matters if you want to build a culture where givers succeed is you actually need a culture where help seeking is the norm <unk> where people ask a lot
2404_AdamGrant_2016S,this may hit a little too close to home for some of you
2405_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> is they recognize that it 's ok to be a receiver too
2406_AdamGrant_2016S,if you run an organization we can actually make this easier we can make it easier for people to ask for help a
2407_AdamGrant_2016S,couple colleagues and i studied hospitals we found that on certain floors <unk> nurses did a lot of help seeking and on other floors they did very little of it
2408_AdamGrant_2016S,the factor that stood out on the floors where help seeking was common where it was the norm
2409_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> was there was just one nurse whose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit
2410_AdamGrant_2016S,when that role was available nurses said it 's not embarrassing it 's not vulnerable to ask for help it 's actually encouraged <unk>
2411_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> important just for protecting the success and the <unk> well being of givers it 's also critical to getting more people to act like givers
2412_AdamGrant_2016S,because the data say that somewhere between seventy five and ninety percent of all giving in organizations
2413_AdamGrant_2016S,starts with a request
2414_AdamGrant_2016S,but a lot of people don 't ask they don 't want to look incompetent they don 't know where to turn they don 't want to burden others
2415_AdamGrant_2016S,yet if nobody ever asks for help you have a lot of frustrated givers in your organization who would love to step up and contribute if they only knew who could benefit and how <unk>
2416_AdamGrant_2016S,but i think the most important thing if you want to build a culture of successful givers is to be thoughtful about who you let onto your team <unk> i figured
2417_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> you want a culture of productive generosity you should hire a bunch of givers <unk> but i was surprised to discover actually that that was not right
2418_AdamGrant_2016S,that the negative impact of a taker on a culture is usually double to triple the positive impact of a giver
2419_AdamGrant_2016S,think about it this way one bad apple can spoil a barrel <unk> but one good egg just does not make a dozen i don 't
2420_AdamGrant_2016S,know what that means
2421_AdamGrant_2016S,laughter but i hope you do no
2422_AdamGrant_2016S,let even one taker into a team <unk> and you will see that the givers
2423_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> will stop helping they 'll say i 'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks why should i contribute
2424_AdamGrant_2016S,whereas if you let one giver into a team you don 't get an explosion of of generosity more often people are like great that person can do all our work
2425_AdamGrant_2016S,so effective hiring and screening and team building is not about bringing in the givers <unk> it 's about weeding out the takers <unk>
2426_AdamGrant_2016S,if you can do that well you 'll be left with givers and
2427_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> givers will be generous because they don 't have to worry about the consequences and the beauty of the matchers is that they follow the norm <unk>
2428_AdamGrant_2016S,so how do you catch a taker before it 's too late we
2429_AdamGrant_2016S,'re actually pretty bad at figuring out who 's a taker especially on first impressions there 's a personality trait that throws us off it 's called agreeableness one the major dimensions of personality across cultures agreeable people are warm and friendly they 're nice they 're polite
2430_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> you find a lot of them in canada
2431_AdamGrant_2016S,where
2432_AdamGrant_2016S,there was actually a national contest to come up with a new canadian slogan and fill in the blank as canadian as i
2433_AdamGrant_2016S,thought the winning entry was going to be as canadian as maple syrup or ice hockey but no canadians voted for their new national slogan to be i kid you not as
2434_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> now for those of you who are highly agreeable or maybe slightly canadian <unk> you
2435_AdamGrant_2016S,get this right away how could i ever say i 'm any one thing when i 'm constantly adapting to try to please other people
2436_AdamGrant_2016S,disagreeable people do less of it they 're more critical skeptical challenging and far more likely than their peers to go to law school
2437_AdamGrant_2016S,that 's not a joke that 's actually an empirical fact
2438_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> assumed that agreeable people were givers and disagreeable people were takers <unk> but then i gathered the data and i was stunned to find no correlation between those traits
2439_AdamGrant_2016S,because it turns out that <unk>
2440_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> is your outer veneer <unk> how pleasant is it to interact with you whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values <unk> what are your intentions toward others
2441_AdamGrant_2016S,if you really want to judge people accurately <unk> you have to get to the moment every consultant in the room is waiting
2442_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> for and draw a two by two
2443_AdamGrant_2016S,the agreeable givers are easy to spot they say yes to everything
2444_AdamGrant_2016S,the disagreeable takers are also recognized quickly although you might call them by a slightly different
2445_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> we forget about the other two combinations there are disagreeable givers in our organizations there
2446_AdamGrant_2016S,are people who are gruff and tough on the surface but underneath have others ' best interests at heart
2447_AdamGrant_2016S,or as an engineer put it oh disagreeable givers like somebody with a bad user interface but a great operating system
2448_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> the ones who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear we need to do a much better job valuing these people as opposed to writing them off early and saying
2449_AdamGrant_2016S,eh kind of prickly <unk> must be a selfish taker
2450_AdamGrant_2016S,the other combination we forget about is the deadly one the agreeable taker also known as the faker
2451_AdamGrant_2016S,this is the person who 's nice to your face and then will stab you right in the back
2452_AdamGrant_2016S,and my favorite way to catch these people in the interview process is to ask the question can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have fundamentally improved
2453_AdamGrant_2016S,the takers will give you four names <unk> and they will all be more influential than them <unk> because takers are great at kissing up and then kicking down
2454_AdamGrant_2016S,givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy who don 't have as much power
2455_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> can do them no good and let 's face it you all know you can learn a lot about character by watching how someone treats their restaurant server or their uber driver <unk>
2456_AdamGrant_2016S,so if we do all this well if we can weed takers out of organizations if we can make it safe to ask for help if we can protect givers from burnout
2457_AdamGrant_2016S,and make it ok for them to be ambitious in pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people we can actually change the way that people define success
2458_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> instead of saying it 's all about winning a competition people will realize success is really more about contribution
2459_AdamGrant_2016S,i believe that the most meaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed <unk>
2460_AdamGrant_2016S,and if we can spread that belief we can actually turn paranoia upside down <unk> there 's a name for that it 's called <unk>
2461_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> is the delusional belief that other people are plotting your
2462_AdamGrant_2016S,that they 're going around behind your back and saying exceptionally glowing things about you <unk>
2463_AdamGrant_2016S,the great thing about a culture of givers is that 's not a delusion it 's reality
2464_AdamGrant_2016S,i want to live in a world where givers succeed <unk> and i hope you will help me create that world
2465_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> this is
2466_AdamGrant_2016S,a work in process <unk> based on some comments that were made at ted two years ago about the need for the storage
2467_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> years ago i had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration one of those things that stuck in my head a lot like the stirling engine it was cool but you didn 't know what to do with
2468_AdamGrant_2016S,<unk> by this guy ferdinand carr but he couldn 't actually build anything with it because of the of the tools at the time this crazy canadian named powel crosley
2469_AdamGrant_2016S,commercialized this thing called the icyball in one thousand nine hundred
2470_AdamGrant_2016S,and twenty eight it was a really neat idea and i 'll get to why it didn 't work but here 's how it works there 's two spheres and they 're separated in distance one has a working fluid water and ammonia and the other is a is a condenser you heat up one side the hot side the ammonia evaporates and it
2471_AdamGrosser_2007,<unk> side <unk> you let it cool to room temperature
2472_AdamGrosser_2007,and then as the ammonia reevaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side <unk> it creates a powerful cooling effect <unk>
2473_AdamGrosser_2007,so it was a great idea that didn 't work at all they blew up
2474_AdamGrosser_2007,because you 're using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong it topped four hundred psi the ammonia was toxic it sprayed everywhere but it was kind of an interesting thought
2475_AdamGrosser_2007,<unk> so the great thing about two thousand and six there 's a lot of really great computational work you can do so we
2476_AdamGrosser_2007,got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved a lot of computational fluid dynamics we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong <unk>
2477_AdamGrosser_2007,we found some nontoxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures we
2478_AdamGrosser_2007,brought in a team from the uk a lot of great refrigeration people it turns
2479_AdamGrosser_2007,<unk> and built a test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low pressure nontoxic refrigerator <unk>
2480_AdamGrosser_2007,so this is the way it works you put it on a cooking fire most people have cooking fires in the world whether it 's camel dung or wood <unk> it heats up for about thirty minutes <unk>
2481_AdamGrosser_2007,cools for an hour you
2482_AdamGrosser_2007,put it into a container and it will refrigerate for twenty four hours it looks like this this is the fifth prototype it 's not quite done it weighs about eight pounds
2483_AdamGrosser_2007,<unk> pounds
2484_AdamGrosser_2007,and this is the way it works you put it into a 15 liter vessel about three gallons
2485_AdamGrosser_2007,and it 'll cool it down to just above freezing three degrees above freezing for twenty four hours in a thirty degree c environment
2486_AdamGrosser_2007,it 's really cheap we think we can build these in high volumes for about twenty five dollars in low volumes for about forty dollars
2487_AdamGrosser_2007,and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have thank you
2488_AdamGrosser_2007,<unk> i promise there won 't be too much of me talking and a lot of derek playing but i thought it would just be nice to recap on how derek got to where he is today
2489_AdamGrosser_2007,it 's amazing now because he 's so much bigger than
2490_AdamGrosser_2007,but when derek was born he could have fitted on the palm of your hand he was born three and a half months premature <unk> and
2491_AdamGrosser_2007,really it was a fantastic fight for him
2492_AdamGrosser_2007,to survive he had to have a lot of oxygen and that affected your eyes derek and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world
2493_AdamGrosser_2007,but that was the end of the bad news because when derek
2494_AdamOckelford_2013X,came came home from the hospital
2495_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny
2496_AdamOckelford_2013X,who was going to look after you derek really for the rest of your childhood
2497_AdamOckelford_2013X,and nanny 's great insight really was to think
2498_AdamOckelford_2013X,here 's a child who can 't see music must be the thing for for derek and sure enough she sang <unk> or as derek called it warbled
2499_AdamOckelford_2013X,to him
2500_AdamOckelford_2013X,for him for his first few years of life and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after
2501_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> every day that made him think maybe you know in his brain something was stirring some sort of musical
2502_AdamOckelford_2013X,gift <unk> here 's a little picture of derek going up now when you were
2503_AdamOckelford_2013X,with your nanny now nanny 's great other insight was to think perhaps we should get derek something
2504_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> and sure enough she dragged this little
2505_AdamOckelford_2013X,keyboard out of the loft <unk>
2506_AdamOckelford_2013X,never thinking really that anything much would come of it <unk>
2507_AdamOckelford_2013X,but derek your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it <unk> bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break but
2508_AdamOckelford_2013X,out of all the bashing after a few months emerged the most fantastic music <unk> and
2509_AdamOckelford_2013X,i think there was just a miracle moment really derek when you realized that all the sounds you hear
2510_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard that was the great eureka moment
2511_AdamOckelford_2013X,now not being able to see meant of course that you taught yourself derek paravicini i taught myself to play ao you did teach yourself to play and
2512_AdamOckelford_2013X,as a consequence playing the piano for you derek was a lot of knuckles and karate chops and even a bit of nose going on in there <unk> and now here 's what
2513_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little
2514_AdamOckelford_2013X,early tape recorders that they had <unk> and this is a wonderful tape now of derek playing when you were four years old
2515_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> little child who can 't see can 't really understand much about the world
2516_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> has no one in the family who plays an instrument and yet he taught himself to play that and as you can see from the picture there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing derek
2517_AdamOckelford_2013X,now <unk> along
2518_AdamOckelford_2013X,derek and i met when he was four and a half years old and
2519_AdamOckelford_2013X,at first derek i thought you were mad to be honest because when you played the piano you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard <unk> and also you had this little habit of
2520_AdamOckelford_2013X,hitting me out of the way so as soon as i tried to get near the piano
2521_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> shoved off and having said to to your dad nic that i would try to teach you i was then slightly confused as to how i might go about that if i wasn 't
2522_AdamOckelford_2013X,allowed near the piano <unk>
2523_AdamOckelford_2013X,but after a while i thought well the only way is to just pick you up
2524_AdamOckelford_2013X,shove derek over to the other side of the room <unk> and in the ten seconds that i got before derek came back <unk> i could just play something very quickly for him to learn <unk>
2525_AdamOckelford_2013X,and in the end
2526_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> i think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the playing the piano together as you can see there 's me in my
2527_AdamOckelford_2013X,my early pre marriage days with a brown beard <unk> and little derek concentrating there
2528_AdamOckelford_2013X,i just realized this is going to be recorded isn 't it right okay
2529_AdamOckelford_2013X,now then by the age of ten derek really had taken the world by storm <unk> this is a photo of you
2530_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> playing at the barbican with the royal philharmonic pops basically it was it was just
2531_AdamOckelford_2013X,an exciting journey really and in those days derek you didn 't speak very much and so
2532_AdamOckelford_2013X,there was always a moment of tension as to whether you 'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you 'd play the right piece in the right key and all that kind of thing but
2533_AdamOckelford_2013X,the orchestra were wowed as well and the press of the world were fascinated by your
2534_AdamOckelford_2013X,to play these fantastic pieces now the question is how do you do it derek and hopefully we can show the audience
2535_AdamOckelford_2013X,now how it is you do what you do
2536_AdamOckelford_2013X,i think that one of the first things that happened when when you were very little derek was that
2537_AdamOckelford_2013X,by the time you were two your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults <unk>
2538_AdamOckelford_2013X,and so whenever you heard
2539_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> any note at all if i just play a random note
2540_AdamOckelford_2013X,you knew instantly what it was and you 'd got the ability as well to find that note
2541_AdamOckelford_2013X,on the piano <unk> now that 's called perfect pitch and
2542_AdamOckelford_2013X,some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano
2543_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> your ear is so much more than that if i just put the microphone down for a bit i 'm going to play a cluster of notes
2544_AdamOckelford_2013X,those of you who can see will know how many notes but derek of course can 't not only
2545_AdamOckelford_2013X,can you say how many notes it 's being able to play them all at the
2546_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> that ability that ability to hear simultaneous sounds not only just single sounds but when a whole orchestra is playing derek you can hear
2547_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> through all those hours and hours of practice reproduce those on the keyboard that makes you <unk> i think is the basis of all your ability <unk>
2548_AdamOckelford_2013X,now then
2549_AdamOckelford_2013X,it 's no use having
2550_AdamOckelford_2013X,that kind of raw ability without the technique <unk> and luckily derek you decided that once we did start learning you 'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings so for
2551_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> and in the end you got so quick that things like flight of the bumblebee
2552_AdamOckelford_2013X,playing things like this
2553_AdamOckelford_2013X,the
2554_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> thing was with all those scales derek <unk> you could not
2555_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> in your brain derek is this amazing musical computer that can instantly
2556_AdamOckelford_2013X,recalibrate <unk> recalculate all the pieces in the world that are out there most pianists would have a heart attack if you said
2557_AdamOckelford_2013X,sorry do you mind playing ' flight of the bumblebee ' in b minor instead of a minor
2558_AdamOckelford_2013X,as we went on in fact <unk> the first time derek <unk> you played that with an orchestra <unk> you 'd learned the version that you 'd learned and then the orchestra
2559_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> did have a different version so
2560_AdamOckelford_2013X,while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to
2561_AdamOckelford_2013X,play it with the orchestra <unk> fantastic chap the other
2562_AdamOckelford_2013X,wonderful thing about you is memory dp memory ao your memory is truly amazing and every concert we do we ask the audience
2563_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> not brave at all because if you ask for something that derek doesn 't know <unk> you 're invited to come and sing it first and then he 'll pick it up
2564_AdamOckelford_2013X,so just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish <unk> but seriously would anyone like to
2565_AdamOckelford_2013X,the
2566_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> you may think thirteen hours is a long time to keep talking but derek does it effortlessly <unk> now then
2567_AdamOckelford_2013X,laughter but in america they 've coined this term the human ipod for derek <unk> which i think is just missing the point really because derek
2568_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> much more than an ipod you 're a fantastic creative musician <unk> and i think that was nowhere clearer to see really than when we went to slovenia <unk>
2569_AdamOckelford_2013X,and someone
2570_AdamOckelford_2013X,in a longer concert we we tend to get people joining in and this person very very nervously came onto the stage
2571_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> i should really get derek 's manager to come and play it he 's sitting there
2572_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> okay
2573_AdamOckelford_2013X,the
2574_AdamOckelford_2013X,thought that all the world was a piano so whenever art tatum plays something it sounds like there 's three pianos in the room <unk> and here is derek 's take on art tatum
2575_AdamOckelford_2013X,the
2576_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> for
2577_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> by the end of this year there 'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites the one thing that all of them have in common
2578_AdamOckelford_2013X,is that they 're going to die <unk>
2579_AdamOckelford_2013X,<unk> while that might be a somewhat morbid thought i think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring <unk>
2580_AdamOckelford_2013X,what first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by derek k miller who was a science and technology
2581_AdamOckelford_2013X,journalist who died of cancer
2582_AdamOckelford_2013X,and what miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died here 's what he wrote in starting that out he said here
2583_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> i 'm dead and this is my last post to my blog
2584_AdamOstrow_2011G,in advance i asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer <unk>
2585_AdamOstrow_2011G,then my family and friends publish this prepared message i wrote the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive
2586_AdamOstrow_2011G,now while as a journalist miller 's archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that 's something completely different than anything that 's been created by
2587_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> any previous generation
2588_AdamOstrow_2011G,consider a few stats for a moment
2589_AdamOstrow_2011G,right now there are forty eight hours of video being uploaded to youtube every single minute <unk>
2590_AdamOstrow_2011G,there are two hundred million tweets being posted every day
2591_AdamOstrow_2011G,and the average facebook user is creating ninety pieces of content each month
2592_AdamOstrow_2011G,so when you think about your parents or your grandparents at best they may have
2593_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> created
2594_AdamOstrow_2011G,some photos or home videos or a diary that lives in a box somewhere <unk>
2595_AdamOstrow_2011G,but today we 're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that 's going to live in the cloud indefinitely <unk> years after we 're gone
2596_AdamOstrow_2011G,and i think that 's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists
2597_AdamOstrow_2011G,now to be clear i 'm a journalist and not a technologist so what i 'd like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look
2598_AdamOstrow_2011G,now we 're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die <unk>
2599_AdamOstrow_2011G,one of them actually fittingly enough found me when i <unk>
2600_AdamOstrow_2011G,checked into a deli at a restaurant in new york on foursquare
2601_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> what that service does quite simply is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to facebook after you die
2602_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> service right now is called one thousand memories and what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones complete with photos and videos and stories
2603_AdamOstrow_2011G,that they can post after you die <unk> but what i think comes next is far more interesting
2604_AdamOstrow_2011G,now a lot of you are probably familiar with deb roy who back in march demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than ninety thousand hours of home video
2605_AdamOstrow_2011G,i think as machines ' ability to
2606_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve <unk> it 's going to become possible to analyze an entire life 's worth of content
2607_AdamOstrow_2011G,the tweets the photos the videos the blog posts that we 're producing in such massive numbers
2608_AdamOstrow_2011G,and i think as that happens it 's going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world
2609_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> long after we 're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we 're creating and technology 's ability to make sense of it all
2610_AdamOstrow_2011G,now we 're already starting to see some experiments here one service called my next tweet analyzes your entire twitter stream everything you 've posted onto twitter to make some predictions as to what you might say next
2611_AdamOstrow_2011G,well right now as you can see the results can be somewhat comical you can imagine what something like this might look like five ten or twenty years from now as our technical capabilities improve
2612_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> it a step further <unk> mit 's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans
2613_AdamOstrow_2011G,but what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person
2614_AdamOstrow_2011G,based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that that person produces in their lifetime
2615_AdamOstrow_2011G,finally think back to this famous scene from election night two thousand and eight back in the united states <unk> where cnn beamed a live hologram of
2616_AdamOstrow_2011G,hip hop artist <unk> will i am into their studio for an interview with anderson cooper
2617_AdamOstrow_2011G,what if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive
2618_AdamOstrow_2011G,i think that 's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we 're producing and technology 's ability to understand it both expand exponentially
2619_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> now in closing i think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality
2620_AdamOstrow_2011G,and if so what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it thank you very much
2621_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> hi there i 'm going to be talking a little bit about
2622_AdamOstrow_2011G,music <unk> machines and life
2623_AdamOstrow_2011G,or more specifically what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video
2624_AdamOstrow_2011G,some of you may recognize this image this is the opening
2625_AdamOstrow_2011G,<unk> frame of the video that we created we 'll be showing the video at the end but before we do i want to talk a little bit about
2626_AdamOstrow_2011G,what it is that they wanted <unk> now when we first started talking to ok go
2627_AdamSadowsky_2010X,the name of the song is this too shall pass
2628_AdamSadowsky_2010X,we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with <unk> and we were very excited about this because
2629_AdamSadowsky_2010X,of course they have a history of
2630_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> dancing with machines
2631_AdamSadowsky_2010X,they 're responsible for this video here it goes again
2632_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> 50 million plus views on youtube <unk> four guys dancing on treadmills
2633_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> no cuts just a static camera a fantastically viral and wonderful video so we were really excited about working with them and
2634_AdamSadowsky_2010X,we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted and they explained that they wanted kind of a rube goldberg machine now for those of you
2635_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> who don 't know a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption an incredibly
2636_AdamSadowsky_2010X,piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task <unk> so we were excited by this idea <unk> and we started talking about exactly what it would look like <unk> and we came up with some parameters <unk> because you know
2637_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> but it also is pretty wide open <unk> and we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video <unk> so
2638_AdamSadowsky_2010X,we came up with a list of requirements the ten commandments and they were in order of ascending difficulty <unk> the first is no magic everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a
2639_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> rule of thumb was that if my mother couldn 't understand it then we couldn 't use it in the video <unk>
2640_AdamSadowsky_2010X,they wanted band integration that is the machine acting upon the band members <unk> specifically not the other way around
2641_AdamSadowsky_2010X,they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling so as the song picks up emotion so should the machine get grander
2642_AdamSadowsky_2010X,in its process they wanted us to make use of the space <unk> so we have this
2643_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> warehouse we were using divided between two floors it included an exterior loading dock we used all of that including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through they wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige
2644_AdamSadowsky_2010X,the machine itself would start the music <unk> so the machine would get started it would travel some distance <unk> reacting along the way <unk> hit play on an ipod or a <unk>
2645_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> tape deck or something that would start playback and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout
2646_AdamSadowsky_2010X,and speaking of synchronization they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way <unk>
2647_AdamSadowsky_2010X,okay
2648_AdamSadowsky_2010X,they wanted it to end precisely on time okay so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect <unk> and they wanted the music to drop out at a
2649_AdamSadowsky_2010X,certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song
2650_AdamSadowsky_2010X,and as if that wasn 't enough all of these incredibly complicating things right <unk> they wanted it in one shot <unk>
2651_AdamSadowsky_2010X,just some statistics
2652_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> get it on film to our satisfaction of those eighty five takes <unk> only three actually successfully completed their run
2653_AdamSadowsky_2010X,we destroyed two pianos and ten televisions in the process <unk> we went to home
2654_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it 's actually in the machine
2655_AdamSadowsky_2010X,so what did we learn from all of this well
2656_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> having completed this we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things <unk> and we learned that small stuff stinks
2657_AdamSadowsky_2010X,little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust <unk> and they fall out of the tracks the exact angles makes it hard to
2658_AdamSadowsky_2010X,to get right and yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path it doesn 't matter what temperature it is doesn 't matter what 's in its way
2659_AdamSadowsky_2010X,will pretty much get where it needs to go <unk> but as much as the small stuff stinks <unk> we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go <unk> and so you have to start with it you have to focus on it small stuff stinks <unk> but of course it 's essential <unk> right <unk>
2660_AdamSadowsky_2010X,what else planning is incredibly important you
2661_AdamSadowsky_2010X,we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things it 's been said
2662_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> no battle plan survives contact with the enemy i think our enemy was physics and
2663_AdamSadowsky_2010X,she 's a cruel mistress <unk>
2664_AdamSadowsky_2010X,often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever <unk> and so while planning is important so is flexibility these are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine
2665_AdamSadowsky_2010X,so also put reliable stuff last
2666_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> stuff that 's going to run every time again small to large
2667_AdamSadowsky_2010X,is relevant here the little lego car in the beginning of the video references the big <unk> real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there 's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and
2668_AdamSadowsky_2010X,that 's a problem but you don 't want to have to reset the whole machine because the lego car at the end doesn 't work right so you put that up front so that if it fails at least you know you know you don 't have to reset the whole thing
2669_AdamSadowsky_2010X,can be messy <unk>
2670_AdamSadowsky_2010X,there were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing <unk> months were spent in this tiny cold warehouse and the wonderful elation that we that we had when we finally completed it so it 's important to remember that whether it 's good or it 's bad
2671_AdamSadowsky_2010X,this too shall
2672_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> and now to introduce their music video <unk> we have ok go
2673_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> we can still do one better i think
2674_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> okay
2675_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> about four years ago the new yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of mauritius
2676_AdamSadowsky_2010X,now the island of mauritius is a small island off the east coast of madagascar in the
2677_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> indian ocean and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered
2678_AdamSadowsky_2010X,and extinguished all within about one hundred and fifty years <unk> everyone was very excited about this
2679_AdamSadowsky_2010X,archaeological find because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton see while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection nobody not even the actual natural history museum on the island of mauritius has a skeleton that 's made from the
2680_AdamSadowsky_2010X,<unk> of a single dodo well this isn 't exactly true
2681_AdamSadowsky_2010X,the fact is is that the british museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century it was actually mummified skin and all but in a fit of
2682_AdamSavage_2008P,space saving zeal they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire if you go look at their website today they 'll actually list these specimens saying the rest was lost in a fire
2683_AdamSavage_2008P,and i 'm one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker because this photo completely rocked my world i became obsessed with the object not just the beautiful photograph <unk>
2684_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> itself and the color the shallow depth of field the detail that 's visible the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together there 's an entire
2685_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> and i thought to myself <unk> wouldn 't it be great if i had my own dodo skeleton <unk>
2686_AdamSavage_2008P,i want to point out here at this point that i 've spent my life obsessed by by objects and the stories that they tell <unk>
2687_AdamSavage_2008P,and this was the very latest one so i began looking around for to see if anyone sold a kit
2688_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> some kind of model that i could get and i found lots of reference material lots of lovely pictures <unk> no dice no dodo skeleton for me <unk> but the damage had been done i had saved a few hundred photos <unk>
2689_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> of dodo skeletons into my creative projects folder it 's a repository for my brain everything that i could possibly be interested in any time i have an internet connection <unk> there 's a sluice of stuff moving into there
2690_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> russian nuclear launch key the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself <unk> because i couldn 't afford the one on ebay <unk>
2691_AdamSavage_2008P,storm trooper costumes maps of middle earth that 's one i hand drew myself there 's the dodo skeleton folder this folder has seventeen thousand photos over twenty gigabytes of information and it 's growing constantly
2692_AdamSavage_2008P,and one day a couple of weeks later it might have been
2693_AdamSavage_2008P,maybe a year later i was in the art store with my kids
2694_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> buying some clay tools we were going to have a craft day i bought some super sculpeys some armature wire some various materials <unk> and i looked down at this sculpey and i thought maybe yeah
2695_AdamSavage_2008P,maybe i could make my own dodo
2696_AdamSavage_2008P,skull <unk> i should point out at this time i 'm not a sculptor <unk> i 'm a hard edged model maker you give me a drawing you give me a prop to replicate you
2697_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> give me a crane
2698_AdamSavage_2008P,scaffolding <unk> parts from star wars especially parts from star wars i can do this stuff all day long <unk> it 's exactly how i made my living for fifteen years <unk>
2699_AdamSavage_2008P,but you give me
2700_AdamSavage_2008P,something like this my friend mike murnane sculpted this it 's a maquette for star wars episode two this is not my thing this is something other people do dragons soft things <unk> however <unk>
2701_AdamSavage_2008P,i felt like i had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it
2702_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> mean it couldn 't be that difficult so
2703_AdamSavage_2008P,i started looking at the best photos i could find <unk> i grabbed all the reference <unk> and i found this lovely piece of reference this is someone selling this on ebay <unk> it was clearly <unk>
2704_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> a womans hand hopefully a woman 's hand <unk> assuming it was roughly the size of my wife 's hand i made some measurements of her thumb and i scaled them out to the size of the skull i blew it up to the actual size and i began using that along with all the other reference that i had comparing it to it as size
2705_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be exactly how long <unk> etc <unk> and over a few hours i eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull and i didn 't mean to continue <unk>
2706_AdamSavage_2008P,i it 's kind of like you know you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time you can 't think about the totality i wasn 't thinking about a dodo skeleton i just noticed that as i finished this skull the armature wire that i had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be and one of the
2707_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> other things i 'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons having collected a couple of hundred
2708_AdamSavage_2008P,i actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them and so button by button vertebrae by vertebrae i built my way down
2709_AdamSavage_2008P,and
2710_AdamSavage_2008P,actually by the end of the day i had a reasonable skull a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis <unk> and again <unk> i kept on going looking for more reference
2711_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> every bit of reference i could find drawings beautiful photos this guy i love this guy he put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler <unk>
2712_AdamSavage_2008P,this is the kind of accuracy that i wanted
2713_AdamSavage_2008P,i replicated every last bone and put it in and after about six weeks i finished painted mounted
2714_AdamSavage_2008P,my own dodo skeleton
2715_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> that i even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo and tap plastics made me although
2716_AdamSavage_2008P,i didn 't photograph it a museum vitrine i don 't have the room for this in my house <unk>
2717_AdamSavage_2008P,but i had to finish what i had started <unk> and this actually represented kind of a sea change to me
2718_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> again like i said my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories
2719_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> that they tell and also making them for myself <unk> obtaining them appreciating them
2720_AdamSavage_2008P,and diving into them and in this folder creative projects there are tons of projects that i 'm currently working on projects that i 've already worked on things that i might want to work on some day <unk> and things that i may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch <unk>
2721_AdamSavage_2008P,but now there was potentially this new category of things that i could sculpt
2722_AdamSavage_2008P,that was different that
2723_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> but that 's honestly relative to sculpting to me that 's easy <unk> and so i went back and looked through my creative projects folder <unk> and i happened across the maltese falcon <unk>
2724_AdamSavage_2008P,now <unk>
2725_AdamSavage_2008P,this is funny for me
2726_AdamSavage_2008P,to fall in love with an object from a hammett novel because if it 's true that the world is divided into two types of people chandler people and hammett people i am absolutely a chandler person but in this case
2727_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> it 's not about the author it 's not about the book or the movie or the story it 's about the object in and of itself <unk> and in this case <unk> this object is plays on
2728_AdamSavage_2008P,a host of levels first of all there 's the object in the world <unk> this is the kniphausen hawk it is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around one thousand seven hundred for a swedish count <unk>
2729_AdamSavage_2008P,and it is very likely the object from which hammett drew his inspiration for the maltese falcon <unk> then there is the fictional bird the one that hammett
2730_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> created for the book built out of words <unk> it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie <unk> in which another object is created a prop that has to represent the thing that hammett <unk>
2731_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> created out of words inspired by the kniphausen hawk <unk> and this represents the falcon in the movie and then there is this fourth level which is a whole new object in the world <unk> the prop made <unk>
2732_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> for the movie the representative of the thing becomes in its own right a whole other
2733_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> thing a whole new object of desire <unk>
2734_AdamSavage_2008P,and so now it was time to do some research <unk> i actually had done some research a few years before it 's why the folder was there i 'd bought a replica a really crappy replica of the maltese falcon on ebay
2735_AdamSavage_2008P,and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference but i discovered in
2736_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> one of the original lead birds had been sold at christie 's in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four
2737_AdamSavage_2008P,and so i contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original christie 's catalogue and in it i found this magnificent picture which included a size reference i was able to scan <unk>
2738_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> the picture blow it up to exactly full size i found other reference avi [ ara ] chekmayan a new jersey editor actually
2739_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to to the auctioneers ' specifications because there was a lot of controversy about it it was made out of resin which wasn 't a common material for <unk>
2740_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> movie props about the time the movie was made it 's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it because i can see it compared to this thing and i can tell you it 's real it 's the real thing it 's made from the exact same mold that this one is in this one because the auction was actually so controversial profiles in history the
2741_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> auction house that sold this i think in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five for about one hundred thousand dollars they actually included you can see here on the bottom not just a front elevation but also a side rear <unk>
2742_AdamSavage_2008P,and other side elevation so now i had all the topology i needed to replicate the maltese falcon what do they do how do you start something like that i really don 't know so what i did was again <unk> like i did with the dodo skull i blew all my reference up to full size
2743_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> and then i began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references so i took sculpey and i built a big block of it and i passed it through until you know i got the right profiles and then slowly
2744_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> feather by feather detail by detail i worked out and achieved working in front of the television and super sculpey here 's me sitting next to my wife
2745_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> took of the entire process as i moved through i achieved
2746_AdamSavage_2008P,a very reasonable facsimile of the maltese falcon but again i am not a sculptor and so i don 't know a lot of the tricks like
2747_AdamSavage_2008P,i don 't know how my friend mike gets beautiful shiny surfaces with his sculpey i certainly wasn 't able to get it
2748_AdamSavage_2008P,so i went down to my shop <unk> and i molded it and i cast it in resin <unk> because in the resin then i could absolutely get the glass smooth finished now there 's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish my preference is about seventy coats of this matte black
2749_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> auto primer i spray it on for about three or four days it drips to hell but it allows me a really really nice gentle sanding surface and i can get it glass smooth oh
2750_AdamSavage_2008P,finishing up with triple zero steel wool now the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie when they finally bring out the bird at the end and they place it on the table they actually spin it so i was able
2751_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> to make sure and i 'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as i 'm holding the light in the same position i 'm getting the same type of reflection on it that 's the level of detail i 'm going into this thing
2752_AdamSavage_2008P,i ended up with this
2753_AdamSavage_2008P,my maltese falcon <unk> and it 's beautiful and i can state with authority at this point in time when i 'd finished it of all of the replicas out there and there is a few this is by far the <unk>
2754_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> most accurate representation of the original maltese falcon than anyone has sculpted now the original one i should tell
2755_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> you is sculpted by a guy named fred sexton this is where
2756_AdamSavage_2008P,it gets weird
2757_AdamSavage_2008P,fred sexton was a friend of this guy george hodel <unk> terrifying guy agreed by many to be the killer of the black dahlia now <unk> james ellroy believes that fred sexton the sculptor of the maltese falcon <unk> killed james elroy 's mother i 'll
2758_AdamSavage_2008P,go you one stranger
2759_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> during the production of a weird comedy sequel to the maltese falcon called the black bird starring george segal <unk> the los angeles county museum of art had a plaster original of the maltese falcon one <unk>
2760_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> of the original six plasters i think made for the movie stolen out of the museum a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie <unk>
2761_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> his original plasters of the maltese falcon and they had it in their cabinet for about fifteen years until it got stolen in january of two thousand and seven
2762_AdamSavage_2008P,it would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly so here i had this falcon and it was lovely it looked really
2763_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> the light worked on it really well it was better than anything that i could achieve or obtain out in the world but there was a problem and the problem was was that
2764_AdamSavage_2008P,i wanted the entirety of the object i wanted the weight behind the object
2765_AdamSavage_2008P,this thing was made of resin and it was too light there 's this group online that i frequent it 's a group of prop crazies just like me called the replica props forum and it 's people who trade make and
2766_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> travel in information about movie props and it turned out that one of the guys there a friend of mine that i
2767_AdamSavage_2008P,never actually met but befriended through some prop deals was the manager of a local foundry he took my master falcon pattern he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for <unk>
2768_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> me <unk> and this is the bronze i got back and this is after some acid etching the one that i ended up with <unk> and this thing <unk> it 's deeply deeply satisfying to me here
2769_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> i want you to pick it up and handle it you want to know
2770_AdamSavage_2008P,how obsessed i am this project 's only for me and yet i went so far as to buy on ebay a one thousand nine hundred and forty one chinese san francisco based newspaper in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped
2771_AdamSavage_2008P,like it is in the movie
2772_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> there you can see it 's weighing in at twenty seven and a half pounds that 's half the weight of my dog huxley <unk>
2773_AdamSavage_2008P,but there 's a problem
2774_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> now here 's the most recent progression of falcons on the far left is a piece of crap a replica i bought on ebay there 's my somewhat ruined sculpey falcon because i had to
2775_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> get it back out of the mold there 's my first casting there 's my master and there 's my bronze there 's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin you lose a little bit <unk>
2776_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> of volume <unk> you lose a little bit of size and when i held my bronze one up against my sculpey one it was shorter by three quarters of an inch
2777_AdamSavage_2008P,why didn 't i remember this why didn 't i
2778_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> start and make it bigger
2779_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> so what do i do i figure i have two options one
2780_AdamSavage_2008P,i can fire a freaking laser at it which i have already done to do a 3d scan there 's a 3d scan of this falcon i had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage i achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3d lithography
2781_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> master of this which i will polish <unk> then i will send to the mold maker and then i will have it done in bronze or
2782_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> there 's this fact that i love that i read somewhere once that
2783_AdamSavage_2008P,one of the things that 's contributed to homo sapiens <unk> ' success as a species is our lack of body hair that our hairlessness
2784_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> our nakedness combined with our invention of clothing <unk> gives us the ability to modulate our body temperature
2785_AdamSavage_2008P,and thus be able to survive in any climate we choose
2786_AdamSavage_2008P,and now we 've evolved to the point where we can 't survive without clothing and it 's more than just utility now it 's a communication everything that we choose to put on is a narrative a story about where we 've been what we 're doing
2787_AdamSavage_2008P,who we want to be
2788_AdamSavage_2008P,<unk> i was a lonely kid i didn 't have an easy time finding friends to play with and i ended up making a lot of my own play i made a lot of my own toys
2789_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> it began with ice cream there was a <unk>
2790_AdamSavage_2016,in my hometown <unk> and they served ice cream from behind the counter in these giant five gallon cardboard tubs <unk> and someone told me i was eight years old someone told me that when they were done with those tubs they
2791_AdamSavage_2016,washed them out and kept them in the back and if you asked they would give you one it took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage but i did <unk>
2792_AdamSavage_2016,and they did they gave me one i went home with this beautiful cardboard tub
2793_AdamSavage_2016,i was trying to figure out what i could do with this exotic material metal ring top and bottom i started turning it over in my head and i realized wait a minute
2794_AdamSavage_2016,my head actually fits inside this thing yeah <unk> i cut a hole out i put some acetate in there and i made myself a space helmet
2795_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> i needed a place to wear the space helmet
2796_AdamSavage_2016,so i found a refrigerator box a couple blocks from home i pushed it home and in my parents '
2797_AdamSavage_2016,guest room closet i turned it into a spaceship <unk> i started with a control panel out of cardboard i cut a hole for a radar screen and put a flashlight underneath it to light <unk>
2798_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> it i put a view screen up which i offset off the back wall and this is where i thought i was being really clever without permission
2799_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> i painted the back wall of the closet black and put a star field which i lit up with some christmas lights
2800_AdamSavage_2016,i found in the attic <unk> and i went on some space missions
2801_AdamSavage_2016,a couple years later <unk> the movie jaws came out i was way too young to see it but i was caught up in jaws fever like everyone else in america at the time there
2802_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> store in my town that had a jaws costume in their window and my mom must have overheard me talking to someone about how awesome i thought this costume was because a couple days before halloween she blew my freaking mind
2803_AdamSavage_2016,by giving me this jaws costume
2804_AdamSavage_2016,now <unk> i recognize it 's a bit of a trope for people of a certain age to complain that kids these days have no idea how good they have it
2805_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> but let me just show you a random sampling of entry level kids ' costumes you can buy online right now and this is the
2806_AdamSavage_2016,my mom bought for me
2807_AdamSavage_2016,this is a paper thin shark face and a vinyl bib with the poster of jaws on it
2808_AdamSavage_2016,and i loved it a
2809_AdamSavage_2016,couple years later my dad took me to a film called excalibur i actually got him to take me to it twice which is no small thing because it is a hard
2810_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> but it wasn 't the blood and guts or the boobs that made me want to go see it again <unk> they helped it was the armor the armor in <unk>
2811_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> beautiful to me these were literally knights in shining
2812_AdamSavage_2016,armor and moreover the knights in excalibur wear their armor everywhere all the time they wear it at dinner <unk> they wear it to bed
2813_AdamSavage_2016,i was like are they reading my mind <unk> i want to wear armor all the time laughter
2814_AdamSavage_2016,so i went back to my favorite material the gateway drug for making corrugated cardboard and i made myself a suit of armor <unk>
2815_AdamSavage_2016,replete with the neck shields and a white horse now that i 've oversold it here 's a picture of the armor that i made
2816_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> this is only the first suit of armor i made inspired by excalibur a couple of years later <unk> i convinced my dad to embark on making me a proper suit of armor
2817_AdamSavage_2016,over about a month he graduated me from cardboard to roofing aluminum called flashing and still one of my all time favorite attachment materials
2818_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> we carefully over that month constructed an articulated suit of aluminum armor with compound curves we drilled holes in the helmet so that i could breathe
2819_AdamSavage_2016,and i finished just in time for halloween and wore it to school <unk> now <unk> this is the one thing in this talk that i don 't have a slide to show you because no photo exists of this armor
2820_AdamSavage_2016,i did wear it to school <unk> there was a yearbook photographer patrolling the halls but he never found me for reasons that are about to become
2821_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> there were things i didn 't anticipate about wearing a complete suit of aluminum armor
2822_AdamSavage_2016,to school
2823_AdamSavage_2016,in third period math i was standing in the back of class and i 'm standing in the back of class because the armor did not allow me to sit down
2824_AdamSavage_2016,this is the first thing i didn 't anticipate and then my teacher looks at me sort of concerned about halfway through the class and says are you feeling ok i 'm thinking are you
2825_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> feeling ok i 'm wearing a suit of armor
2826_AdamSavage_2016,i am having the time of my and i 'm just about to tell her how great i feel when the classroom starts to list to the left and disappear down this long tunnel and then i woke up in the nurse 's office
2827_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> i had passed out from heat exhaustion wearing the armor <unk> and when i woke up i wasn 't embarrassed about having passed out in front of my class
2828_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> a whole bunch of years some colleagues and i get hired to make a show for discovery channel called mythbusters and over fourteen years <unk> i learn on the job how to build experimental methodologies and how to tell stories about them for television
2829_AdamSavage_2016,i also learn early on that costuming can play a key role in this storytelling i use costumes to add humor <unk> comedy <unk> color and narrative clarity to the stories we 're telling
2830_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> then we do an episode called dumpster diving and i learn a little bit more about the deeper implications of what costuming means to me in
2831_AdamSavage_2016,the episode dumpster diving the question we were trying to answer is is jumping into a dumpster as safe as the movies would lead you to believe laughter
2832_AdamSavage_2016,the episode was going to have two distinct parts to
2833_AdamSavage_2016,one was where we get trained to jump off buildings by a stuntman into an air bag
2834_AdamSavage_2016,and the second was the graduation to the experiment we 'd fill a dumpster full of material and we 'd jump into it i wanted to visually separate these two elements <unk> and i thought well
2835_AdamSavage_2016,for the first part we 're training so we should wear
2836_AdamSavage_2016,sweatsuits oh let 's put ' stunt trainee ' on the back of the sweatsuits that 's for the training but for the second part i wanted something really visually
2837_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> so i went to haight street i bought some beautiful knee high
2838_AdamSavage_2016,buckle boots i found a long flowing coat on ebay i got sunglasses which i had to wear contact lenses in order to wear the day of the experiment shoot comes up and i step out of my car in this costume and my crew takes a look at me
2839_AdamSavage_2016,and start suppressing their church giggles <unk> they 're like
2840_AdamSavage_2016,total embarrassment over the fact that it 's so nakedly clear to my crew that i 'm completely into wearing this costume
2841_AdamSavage_2016,laughter but the producer in my mind reminds myself that in the high speed shot in slow mo that flowing coat is going to look beautiful behind me
2842_AdamSavage_2016,five years into the mythbusters
2843_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> we got invited to appear at san diego comic con i 'd known about comic con for years and never had time to go this was the big leagues this was costuming mecca people <unk>
2844_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> fly in from all over the world to show their amazing creations on the floor in san diego and i wanted to participate i decided that i would put together an elaborate costume that covered me completely and i would walk the floor of san diego <unk> comic con anonymously
2845_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> the costume i chose hellboy that 's not my costume that 's actually hellboy
2846_AdamSavage_2016,but i spent months assembling the most screen accurate hellboy costume i could from the boots to the belt to the pants to the right hand of doom i found a guy who made a prosthetic <unk>
2847_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> hellboy head and chest and i put them on i even had contact lenses made in my prescription i wore it onto the floor at comic con and i can 't even tell you how balls hot it was in that costume
2848_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> sweating i should 've remembered this i 'm sweating buckets and the contact lenses hurt my eyes and none of it matters because i 'm totally in love
2849_AdamSavage_2016,not just with the process of putting on this costume and walking the floor but also with the community of other costumers it 's not called costuming at cons
2850_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> now ostensibly cosplay means people who dress up as their favorite characters from film and television and especially anime but it is so much more than that these aren 't just people who <unk>
2851_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> find a costume and put it on they mash them up they bend them to their will they change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions they 're super clever and genius they let their freak flag fly and it 's
2852_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> but more than that they rehearse their costumes at comic con or any other con you don 't just take pictures of people walking around you go up and say hey i like your costume can i take your picture and then you <unk>
2853_AdamSavage_2016,give them time to get into their pose they 've worked hard on their pose to make their costume look great for your camera <unk> and it 's so beautiful to watch <unk>
2854_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> and i take this to heart at subsequent cons i learn heath ledger 's shambling walk as the joker from the dark knight
2855_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> how to be a scary ringwraith from lord of the rings and i actually frighten some children i learned that <unk>
2856_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> head laugh that chewbacca does <unk>
2857_AdamSavage_2016,and then i dressed up as no face from spirited away
2858_AdamSavage_2016,if you don 't know about spirited away and its director hayao miyazaki first of all you 're welcome this
2859_AdamSavage_2016,is a masterpiece and one of my all time favorite films it 's about a young girl named
2860_AdamSavage_2016,gets lost in the spirit world in an abandoned japanese theme park
2861_AdamSavage_2016,and she finds her way back out again with the help of a couple of friends she makes a captured dragon named <unk> haku and a lonely demon named <unk>
2862_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> is lonely and he wants to make friends and he thinks the way to do it is by luring them to him and producing gold in his
2863_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> but this doesn 't go very well and so he ends up going on kind of a rampage until chihiro saves him rescues him <unk>
2864_AdamSavage_2016,so i put together a no face costume
2865_AdamSavage_2016,and i wore it on the floor at comic con
2866_AdamSavage_2016,and i very carefully practiced no face 's gestures i resolved i would not speak in this costume at all
2867_AdamSavage_2016,when people asked to take my picture i would nod and and i would shyly stand next to them
2868_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> they would take the picture and then i would secret out from behind my robe a chocolate gold coin and at the end of the photo process i 'd make it appear for them <unk>
2869_AdamSavage_2016,like that and people were freaking out holy crap gold from no face oh my god this is so cool and i 'm feeling and i 'm walking the floor and it 's fantastic and
2870_AdamSavage_2016,about fifteen minutes in something happens <unk>
2871_AdamSavage_2016,somebody grabs my
2872_AdamSavage_2016,and they put a coin back into it and i think maybe they 're giving me a coin as a return gift but no this is one of the coins that i 'd given away <unk>
2873_AdamSavage_2016,i don 't know why <unk> and i keep on going i take some more pictures <unk> and then it happens again
2874_AdamSavage_2016,understand <unk> i can 't see anything inside this costume i can see through the mouth i can see people 's shoes <unk> i can hear what they 're saying and i can see their feet <unk> but the third time
2875_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> someone gives me back a coin i want to know what 's going on
2876_AdamSavage_2016,so i sort of tilt my head back to get a better view <unk> and what i see is someone walking away from me going like this <unk>
2877_AdamSavage_2016,and then it hits me it 's bad luck to take gold from no face in the film spirited away
2878_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> is cosplay
2879_AdamSavage_2016,we are all of us on that floor injecting ourselves into a narrative that meant something to us and we 're making it our own
2880_AdamSavage_2016,we 're connecting with something important
2881_AdamSavage_2016,inside of us and the costumes are how we reveal ourselves to each other thank you
2882_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> pure mathematics and world debating championships <unk> or as i like to say hello ladies
2883_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> didn 't get much sexier than the spence at university let me tell you it is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from sydney australia to be here on the ted stage literally
2884_AdamSavage_2016,on the other side of the world and i wanted to let you know a lot of the things you 've heard about australians are true from the youngest of ages we display a prodigious sporting talent
2885_AdamSavage_2016,on the field of battle we are
2886_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> and noble warriors what you 've heard is true australians we don 't mind a bit of a drink
2887_AdamSavage_2016,<unk> sometimes to excess leading to embarrassing social situations this is
2888_AdamSavage_2016,my father 's work christmas party december <unk>
2889_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> i 'm almost five years old fair to say i 'm enjoying the day a lot more than santa was but
2890_AdamSpencer_2013,i stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host not as a comedian but as someone who was
2891_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> is and always will be
2892_AdamSpencer_2013,a mathematician
2893_AdamSpencer_2013,and anyone who 's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep <unk> i cast my mind back when i was in second grade
2894_AdamSpencer_2013,at a beautiful little government run school called boronia park in the suburbs of sydney <unk> and as we came up towards lunchtime our teacher
2895_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> said to the class hey year two <unk> what do you want to do after lunch i 've got no plans it
2896_AdamSpencer_2013,was an exercise in democratic schooling <unk> and i am all for democratic schooling but we were only seven
2897_AdamSpencer_2013,so some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical <unk>
2898_AdamSpencer_2013,and after a while someone made a particularly silly suggestion and ms russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism that wouldn 't work
2899_AdamSpencer_2013,that 'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole
2900_AdamSpencer_2013,'t trying to be funny i just politely raised my hand and when ms russell acknowledged me i said in front of my year two classmates <unk> and i quote
2901_AdamSpencer_2013,but miss <unk>
2902_AdamSpencer_2013,surely if the diagonal of the square
2903_AdamSpencer_2013,is less than the diameter of the circle well the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole
2904_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> it 'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop wouldn 't it and there was that same awkward silence from most of my classmates until
2905_AdamSpencer_2013,sitting next to me one of my friends one of the cool kids in class steven leaned across and punched me really hard in the head
2906_AdamSpencer_2013,now what steven was saying was look adam you are at a critical juncture in your life here my friend you can keep sitting here with us
2907_AdamSpencer_2013,any more of that sort of talk you 've got to go and sit over there
2908_AdamSpencer_2013,with them
2909_AdamSpencer_2013,i thought about it for a nanosecond i took one look at the road map of life <unk>
2910_AdamSpencer_2013,and i ran off down the street marked geek as fast as my chubby <unk> asthmatic little legs would carry me <unk>
2911_AdamSpencer_2013,i fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages i explained it
2912_AdamSpencer_2013,all my friends maths is beautiful <unk> it 's natural it 's everywhere numbers are the musical notes
2913_AdamSpencer_2013,with which the symphony of the universe is written
2914_AdamSpencer_2013,the great descartes said something quite similar the universe is written in the mathematical language and today <unk> i want to show you one of those musical notes a number
2915_AdamSpencer_2013,so beautiful
2916_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> massive i think it will blow your mind
2917_AdamSpencer_2013,today we 're going to talk about prime numbers most of you i 'm sure remember that six is not prime because it 's two x three
2918_AdamSpencer_2013,seven is prime
2919_AdamSpencer_2013,because it 's one x seven but we can 't break it down into any smaller chunks or as we call them <unk> factors <unk> now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers <unk> one is not prime <unk> the proof
2920_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties
2921_AdamSpencer_2013,another thing about primes there is no final biggest prime number they keep going on forever we know there are an infinite number <unk>
2922_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> of primes due to the brilliant mathematician euclid over thousands of years ago he proved that for us
2923_AdamSpencer_2013,what is the biggest prime that we know about today we 're going to hunt for that massive prime <unk>
2924_AdamSpencer_2013,don 't freak out
2925_AdamSpencer_2013,all you need to know of all the mathematics you 've ever learned <unk> unlearned <unk> crammed <unk> forgotten <unk> never understood in the first place
2926_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> is a prime number <unk> and that five in the power is also a prime number <unk>
2927_AdamSpencer_2013,and the vast bulk of massive primes we 've ever found are of that form <unk> two to a prime number <unk> take away one <unk> i won 't go into great detail as to why because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if i do
2928_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> suffice to say a number of that form is fairly easy to test
2929_AdamSpencer_2013,for primacy a random odd number is a lot harder to test
2930_AdamSpencer_2013,but as soon as we go hunting for massive primes we realize it 's not enough just to put in any prime number in the power
2931_AdamSpencer_2013,one = two thousand and forty seven and you don 't need me to tell you
2932_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> prime numbers after that point they thin out a lot
2933_AdamSpencer_2013,and one of the things about the search for massive primes that i love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search this is the great swiss mathematician leonhard euler
2934_AdamSpencer_2013,in the <unk> 1700s other mathematicians said he is simply the master
2935_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> he was so respected they put him on european currency back when that was a compliment
2936_AdamSpencer_2013,euler discovered at the time the world 's biggest prime two <unk>
2937_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> one it 's over two billion <unk> he proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill ink paper and his mind
2938_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> but one of the great things about the search for massive primes it 's not just finding the primes <unk>
2939_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> digits long was not prime <unk>
2940_AdamSpencer_2013,but he didn 't know what the factors were
2941_AdamSpencer_2013,we knew it was like six but we didn 't know what are the two x three that multiply together to give us that massive number we didn 't know for almost forty years until frank nelson cole came along
2942_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> a gathering of prestigious american mathematicians he walked to the board took up a piece of chalk <unk> and started writing out the powers of two <unk>
2943_AdamSpencer_2013,sixteen come on join in with me you know how it goes
2944_AdamSpencer_2013,powers of two <unk> he took away one and wrote that number on the board a frisson of excitement went around the room
2945_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> it got even more exciting when he then wrote down these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format and for the rest of the hour of his talk
2946_AdamSpencer_2013,frank nelson cole busted that out
2947_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> he had found the prime factors of two <unk>
2948_AdamSpencer_2013,the room went berserk
2949_AdamSpencer_2013,as frank nelson cole sat down having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words <unk>
2950_AdamSpencer_2013,he admitted afterwards it wasn 't that hard to do it took focus <unk> it took dedication <unk> it took him by his estimate
2951_AdamSpencer_2013,years of sundays
2952_AdamSpencer_2013,but then in the field of mathematics as in so many of the fields that we 've heard from in this ted <unk>
2953_AdamSpencer_2013,the age of the computer goes along and things explode <unk>
2954_AdamSpencer_2013,these are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade each one dwarfing the one before as
2955_AdamSpencer_2013,computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew this is the largest prime number we <unk>
2956_AdamSpencer_2013,a very emotional year for me
2957_AdamSpencer_2013,it was the year i left university <unk> i was torn between mathematics and media <unk> it was a tough decision i loved university
2958_AdamSpencer_2013,my arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life
2959_AdamSpencer_2013,but i came to a realization about my own ability put simply in a room full of randomly selected people
2960_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> i 'm a maths genius in a roomful of maths ph ds i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers
2961_AdamSpencer_2013,my skill is not in the mathematics it is in telling the story of the mathematics
2962_AdamSpencer_2013,and during that time since i 've left university these numbers have got bigger and bigger <unk> each one dwarfing the last until
2963_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> curtis cooper
2964_AdamSpencer_2013,who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime
2965_AdamSpencer_2013,only to see it snatched away by a rival university <unk> and then curtis cooper got it back
2966_AdamSpencer_2013,not years ago not months ago <unk>
2967_AdamSpencer_2013,days ago in an amazing moment of serendipity i had to send ted a new slide
2968_AdamSpencer_2013,to show you what this guy had done <unk> i still remember
2969_AdamSpencer_2013,i still remember when it happened i was doing my breakfast radio show i looked down on twitter there was a tweet adam have you seen the new largest prime number i shivered
2970_AdamSpencer_2013,contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room and said girls hold the front page <unk>
2971_AdamSpencer_2013,we 're not talking politics today we 're not talking sport today <unk> they
2972_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> the girls just shook their heads <unk> put them in their hands <unk> and let me go my own way it 's because of curtis cooper that we know <unk>
2973_AdamSpencer_2013,currently the largest prime number we know is two
2974_AdamSpencer_2013,eight hundred and
2975_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> one hundred and sixty one don 't forget to subtract the one <unk> this number is almost seventeen and a half
2976_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> if you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file that 's
2977_AdamSpencer_2013,meg for the slightly less geeky of you think about the harry potter novels okay <unk> this is the first harry potter novel
2978_AdamSpencer_2013,this is all seven harry potter novels because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end
2979_AdamSpencer_2013,written out as a book
2980_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> this number would run the length of the harry potter novels and half again <unk>
2981_AdamSpencer_2013,here 's a slide of the first one thousand digits of this prime <unk>
2982_AdamSpencer_2013,if when ted had begun at eleven o 'clock on tuesday we 'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second <unk> it would have taken five hours to show you that number
2983_AdamSpencer_2013,i was keen to do it could not convince bono <unk> that 's the way
2984_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> this number is seventeen and a half thousand slides long <unk> and we know it is prime
2985_AdamSpencer_2013,as confidently as we know the number seven is prime
2986_AdamSpencer_2013,that fills me with almost sexual excitement <unk>
2987_AdamSpencer_2013,and who am i kidding when i say almost
2988_AdamSpencer_2013,i know what you 're thinking
2989_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> we 're happy
2990_AdamSpencer_2013,that you 're happy <unk>
2991_AdamSpencer_2013,but why should we care <unk>
2992_AdamSpencer_2013,let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful first of all as i explained to ask a computer is that number prime to type it in its abbreviated form <unk>
2993_AdamSpencer_2013,and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy is a remarkably simple question to ask
2994_AdamSpencer_2013,it 's got a remarkably clear yes no answer
2995_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> and just requires phenomenal grunt
2996_AdamSpencer_2013,large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips <unk> but secondly as curtis cooper was looking for that monster prime he wasn 't the only guy searching
2997_AdamSpencer_2013,my laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large
2998_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> the discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling rna sequences in searching through data from seti and other astronomical projects we live in an age
2999_AdamSpencer_2013,where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia
3000_AdamSpencer_2013,but on laptops <unk> desktops in the palms of people 's hands who are simply helping out for the search <unk>
3001_AdamSpencer_2013,but for me it 's amazing because it 's a metaphor for the time in which we live
3002_AdamSpencer_2013,when human minds and machines can conquer
3003_AdamSpencer_2013,together <unk> we 've heard a lot about robots in this ted we 've heard a lot about what they can and can 't do it is true you can now download onto your smartphone an app
3004_AdamSpencer_2013,that would beat most grandmasters at chess you think that 's cool here 's a machine doing something cool this is the cubestormer ii
3005_AdamSpencer_2013,it can take a randomly shuffled
3006_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> using the power of the smartphone <unk> it can examine the cube and solve the cube
3007_AdamSpencer_2013,in five seconds
3008_AdamSpencer_2013,that scares some people <unk> that excites me <unk>
3009_AdamSpencer_2013,how lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together <unk> i was asked in an interview
3010_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> last year in my capacity as a lower case c celebrity in australia what was your highlight of two thousand and twelve
3011_AdamSpencer_2013,people were expecting me to talk about my beloved sydney swans football team <unk>
3012_AdamSpencer_2013,in our beautiful <unk> indigenous sport of australian football they won the equivalent of the super bowl <unk> i was there it was the most emotional exciting day <unk> it wasn 't my highlight of two thousand and twelve
3013_AdamSpencer_2013,people thought it might have been an interview i 'd done on my show it might have been a politician it might have been a breakthrough it might have been a book i read
3014_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> the arts no no no it might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done no it wasn 't the highlight of two thousand and twelve so clearly
3015_AdamSpencer_2013,was the discovery of the higgs boson
3016_AdamSpencer_2013,give it up for the fundamental particle
3017_AdamSpencer_2013,that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass and
3018_AdamSpencer_2013,what was so gorgeous about this discovery was fifty years ago peter higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions
3019_AdamSpencer_2013,how is it that
3020_AdamSpencer_2013,the things that make us up have no mass <unk> i 've clearly got mass <unk>
3021_AdamSpencer_2013,where does it come from and he postulated a suggestion that there 's this infinite
3022_AdamSpencer_2013,incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe <unk> and as other particles go through those particles and interact <unk> that 's where they get their mass <unk> the rest of the scientific community said
3023_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> higgsy <unk> we 've got no idea if we could ever prove it it 's beyond our reach and within just fifty years
3024_AdamSpencer_2013,in his lifetime with him sitting in the audience <unk>
3025_AdamSpencer_2013,we had designed the greatest machine ever
3026_AdamSpencer_2013,to prove this incredible idea that originated
3027_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> that 's what is so exciting for me about this prime number we thought it might be there <unk>
3028_AdamSpencer_2013,and we went and found it
3029_AdamSpencer_2013,that is the essence of being human
3030_AdamSpencer_2013,that is what we are all about or as my friend descartes might put it we think
3031_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> we 're declaring war against cancer <unk> and we will win this war by two thousand and fifteen
3032_AdamSpencer_2013,this is what the us congress and the national cancer institute declared just just a few years ago in two thousand and three
3033_AdamSpencer_2013,<unk> i don 't buy that i don 't think we quite won this war yet <unk> and i don 't think anyone here will will question that <unk>
3034_AdamSpencer_2013,now <unk> i will argue that a primary reason why we 're not winning this war against cancer is because we 're fighting blindly
3035_AdamSpencer_2013,i 'm going to start by sharing with you a story about a good friend of mine his name is ehud
3036_AdamSpencer_2013,and
3037_AdamSpencer_2013,a few years ago ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer and not just any type of brain cancer he was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer in fact it was so deadly that
3038_AdamSpencer_2013,doctors told him that they only have twelve months <unk> and during those twelve months they have to find a treatment they have to find a cure <unk>
3039_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and if they cannot find a cure <unk> he will die <unk>
3040_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,now the good news they said is that there are tons of different treatments to choose from but the bad news
3041_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,is that in order for them to tell if a treatment is even working or not well that takes them about three months or so so they cannot try that many things
3042_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> well <unk> ehud is now going into his first treatment <unk>
3043_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and during that first treatment just a few days into that treatment i 'm meeting with him and he tells me adam i think this is working i think we really lucked out here
3044_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> something is happening and i ask him really <unk> how do you know that ehud and he says well i feel so terrible inside
3045_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> something 's gotta be working up there it just has to
3046_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> three months later we got the news <unk> it didn 't work <unk>
3047_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and so ehud goes into his second treatment <unk> and again the same story it feels so bad something 's gotta be working there
3048_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and then three months later again we get bad news ehud
3049_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,is going into his third treatment and then his fourth treatment <unk> and then as predicted <unk> ehud dies <unk>
3050_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,now <unk> when someone really close to you is going through such a huge struggle you get really swamped with emotions a lot of things are going through your head
3051_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> for me it was mostly outrage i was just outraged that
3052_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,that how come this is the best that we can offer <unk>
3053_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and i started looking more and more into this as it turns out this is not just the best that doctors could offer ehud it 's not just the best doctors could offer
3054_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,patients with brain cancer generally we 're actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer <unk>
3055_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,i picked up one of those statistics and i 'm sure some of you have seen those statistics before
3056_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> this is going to show you here how many patients actually died of cancer in this case females in the united states <unk> ever since the <unk>
3057_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> notice that there aren 't that many things that have changed it 's still a huge issue
3058_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,you 'll see a few changes though you 'll see lung cancer for example on the rise <unk> thank you cigarettes <unk>
3059_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and you 'll also see that for example stomach cancer once used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers is essentially eliminated
3060_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,now why is that anyone knows by the way why is it that that humanity is no longer struck by stomach cancer <unk> what was the huge huge
3061_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,medical technology breakthrough that came to our world that saved humanity from from stomach cancer
3062_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> was it maybe a new drug <unk> or a better diagnostic you guys are right
3063_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> it 's the invention of the refrigerator and the fact that we 're no longer eating spoiled meats so the best thing that happened to us so far
3064_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,in the medical arena in cancer research is the fact that the refrigerator was invented
3065_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,laughter and so yeah <unk> i know we 're not doing so well here i don 't want to miniaturize the progress and
3066_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and everything that 's been done in cancer research look there is like 50 plus years of good cancer research
3067_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,that discovered major major things that taught us about cancer <unk> but all that said
3068_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> we have a lot of heavy lifting to still do ahead of us
3069_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,again i will argue that the primary reason why this is the case why we have not done that remarkably well is really we 're fighting blindly here and this is where medical imaging comes in this is where my own work comes in
3070_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and so to give you a sense of the best medical imaging that 's offered today to brain cancer patients or actually generally to all cancer patients take a look at this pet scan
3071_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> right here let 's see there we go so this is a pet ct scan and what you 'll see in this pet ct scan
3072_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,is the ct scan will show you where the bones are and the pet scan will show you where tumors are
3073_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,now <unk> what you can see here is essentially a sugar molecule that was added a small little tag that is
3074_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> and those sugar molecules are injected into these patients by the billions and they 're going all over the body looking for cells that are hungry for sugar
3075_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,you 'll see that the heart for example lights up there that 's because the heart needs a lot of sugar
3076_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,you 'll also see that the bladder lights up there that 's because the bladder is the thing that 's clearing the sugar away from our body
3077_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and then you 'll see a few other hot spots and these
3078_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> a wonderful technology for the first time it allowed us to look into someone 's body without picking up each and every one of the cells and putting them under the microscope but in a noninvasive way
3079_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,allowing us to look into someone 's body and ask hey <unk> has the cancer metastasized where is it and the pet scans here are showing you very clearly
3080_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,where are these hot spots where is the tumor <unk> so <unk>
3081_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> as miraculous as this might seem unfortunately well <unk> it 's not that great
3082_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> you see those small little hot spots there can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors <unk>
3083_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,so it 's about one hundred million cancer cells and let me make sure that this number sunk in
3084_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,in each and every one of these small little blips that you 're seeing on the image there needs to be at least one hundred million
3085_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> cancer cells in order for it to be detected now if that seemed to you like a very large number it is a very large number
3086_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,this is in fact an incredibly large number because what we really need in order to pick up something early enough to do something about it to do something meaningful about it
3087_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,well <unk> we need to pick up tumors that are a thousand cells in size <unk> and ideally just a handful of cells in size <unk> so we 're clearly pretty far away from this
3088_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,so we 're going to play a little
3089_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,experiment here i 'm going to ask each of you to now play and imagine that you are brain
3090_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> surgeons and you guys are now at an operating room and there 's a patient in front of you
3091_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and your task is to make sure that the tumor is out <unk>
3092_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,so you 're looking down at the patient
3093_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> the skin and the skull have already been removed so you 're looking at the brain <unk> and all you know about this patient
3094_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> there 's a tumor about the size of a golf ball or so
3095_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,in the right frontal lobe of this person 's brain
3096_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and that 's more or less it <unk> so you 're looking down and unfortunately everything looks the same because brain cancer tissue and healthy brain tissue really just look the same <unk>
3097_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and so you 're going in with your thumb and you start to press a little bit on the brain because tumors tend to be a little harder stiffer <unk> and so you go in and go a little bit like this and say it seems like the
3098_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> then you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor piece by piece by piece and as you 're taking the tumor out
3099_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,then you 're getting to a stage where you think alright i 'm done i took out everything
3100_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and at this stage if that 's so far everything sounded like pretty crazy you 're now about to face the most challenging decision of your life here <unk>
3101_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,because now you need to decide should i stop here <unk> and let this patient go <unk> risking that
3102_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> might be some leftover cancer cells behind that i just couldn 't see
3103_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,or should i take away some extra margins typically about an inch or so around the tumor just to be sure that i removed everything <unk>
3104_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,so this is not a simple
3105_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,decision to make and unfortunately this is the decision that that brain cancer surgeons have to take every single day as they 're seeing their patients <unk>
3106_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and so i remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab and
3107_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> but not just like you tell a friend that there 's got to be a better way there 's just got to be a better way here
3108_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,this is just incredible <unk> and so
3109_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,we looked back remember those pet scans i told you about the sugar and so on we said hey <unk> how about instead of using sugar molecules <unk> let 's maybe take tiny tiny little particles made of gold
3110_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and let 's program them with some interesting chemistry around them let 's program them to look for cancer cells and
3111_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> these gold particles into these patients
3112_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,by the billions again and we 'll have them go all over the body and just like secret agents if you will go
3113_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and walk by every single cell in our body and knock on the door of that cell and ask are you a cancer cell or are you a healthy cell if you 're a healthy cell we 're moving on if you 're a cancer cell we 're sticking in and shining out and telling us
3114_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> do it through some interesting cameras that we developed in the lab <unk> and once we see that maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons towards taking only the tumor and leaving the healthy brain alone
3115_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> and so we 've tested that and boy this works well <unk> so i 'm going to show you an example now <unk>
3116_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,what you 're looking at here
3117_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,is an image of a mouse 's brain <unk> and we 've implanted into this mouse 's brain
3118_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,a small little tumor and so this tumor is now growing in this mouse 's brain
3119_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> and then we 've taken a doctor and asked the doctor to please operate on the mouse as if
3120_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,that was a patient
3121_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and take out piece by piece out of the tumor and while he 's doing that we 're going to take images to see where the gold particles are <unk> and so we 're going to first start
3122_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,by injecting these gold particles into this mouse and we 're going to see right here at the very left there that image at the bottom is the image that shows where the gold particles
3123_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> that these gold particles actually made it all the way to the tumor and then they shine out and tell us hey we 're here here 's the tumor
3124_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,so now we can see the tumor but we 're not showing this to the doctor yet <unk>
3125_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,we 're asking the doctor now please start cutting away the tumor and you 'll see here the doctor just took the first quadrant of the tumor and you see that first quadrant is now missing
3126_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,the doctor then took the second quadrant the third and now it appears to be everything <unk>
3127_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and so at this stage the doctor came back
3128_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> to us and said alright i 'm done
3129_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,what do you want me to do should i keep things as they are or do you want me to take some extra margins around and then we said well hang on
3130_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,we told the doctor you 've missed those two spots so rather than taking huge margins around <unk> only take out those tiny little areas
3131_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,take them out and then let 's take a look and so the doctor took them away <unk>
3132_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and
3133_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,lo and behold the cancer is now completely gone now the important thing is that it 's not
3134_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> that the cancer is completely gone from this person 's brain or from this mouse 's brain
3135_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,the most important thing is that we did not have to take huge amounts of of healthy brain in the process <unk>
3136_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and so now we can actually imagine a world where doctors and surgeons as they take away a tumor they actually know what to take out and they no longer have to guess with
3137_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> here 's why it 's extremely important to take those tiny little leftover tumors those leftover tumors <unk> even if it 's just a handful of cells they will grow
3138_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,to recur the tumor <unk> for the tumor to come back in fact the reason why eighty to ninety percent of those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail is because of those small little
3139_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,extra margins that were left positive those small little leftover tumors that were left there <unk> so
3140_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,this is clearly very nice but what i really want to share with you is where i think
3141_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> we 're heading from here <unk> and so in my lab at stanford my students and i are
3142_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,what should we be working on now <unk> and i think where medical imaging is heading to
3143_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,is the ability to look into the human body and actually see each and every one of these cells separately
3144_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,the ability like this would allow us to to actually pick up tumors way way earlier in the process way before it 's one hundred
3145_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> million cells inside so we can actually do something about it
3146_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,an ability to to see each and every one of the cells might also allow us to ask insightful questions so in the lab we are now getting to a point where we can actually start asking these these cancer cells real questions like for example are you responding to the treatment we are giving you or not
3147_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,so if you 're not responding we 'll know to stop the treatment right away days into the treatment not three months <unk>
3148_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,and so also for patients like
3149_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,like ehud that are going through these nasty nasty chemotherapy
3150_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,drugs for them not to suffer through those horrendous
3151_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,side effects of the drugs when the drugs are in fact not even helping them so
3152_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,to be frank here <unk> we 're pretty far away from from winning the war against cancer just to be realistic but
3153_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,at least i am hopeful that we should be able to fight this war with better medical imaging techniques in the way that is not blind <unk> thank you
3154_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> a natural biological process that every girl and woman goes through every month
3155_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,for about half of her life a phenomenon that is so significant that the survival and propagation of our species depends on it <unk>
3156_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,yet we consider it a taboo <unk> we feel awkward and shameful talking about it
3157_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> when i got my first periods i was told to keep it a secret from others
3158_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,even from my father and brother
3159_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,<unk> later when this chapter appeared in our textbooks our biology teacher skipped the subject
3160_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,you know what i learned from it <unk>
3161_AdamdelaZerda_2016X,i learned that it is really shameful to talk about it <unk> i learned to be ashamed of my body <unk> i learned to stay unaware
3162_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> in order to stay decent
3163_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> research in various parts of india shows that three out of every ten girls are not aware of menstruation at the time of their first periods <unk>
3164_AditiGupta_2015X,and in some parts of rajasthan this number is as high as
3165_AditiGupta_2015X,nine out of ten girls being unaware of it <unk>
3166_AditiGupta_2015X,you 'd be surprised to know that most of the girls that i have spoken to who did not know about periods at the time of their first menstruation thought that they have got blood cancer
3167_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> and they 're going to die soon
3168_AditiGupta_2015X,menstrual hygiene is a very important risk factor for reproductive tract infections <unk>
3169_AditiGupta_2015X,but in india only twelve percent of girls and women have access to
3170_AditiGupta_2015X,hygienic ways of managing their periods <unk>
3171_AditiGupta_2015X,if you do the math eighty eight percent of girls and women use unhygienic ways to manage their periods <unk> i was one
3172_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> of them <unk>
3173_AditiGupta_2015X,i grew up in a small town called garhwa in jharkhand where even buying a sanitary napkin is considered shameful
3174_AditiGupta_2015X,so when i started getting my periods <unk> i began with using rags <unk>
3175_AditiGupta_2015X,after every use i would wash and reuse them <unk> but to store them i would hide and keep it in a dark
3176_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> damp place so that nobody finds out that i 'm menstruating <unk>
3177_AditiGupta_2015X,due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse <unk> and i would often get rashes and infections using them <unk>
3178_AditiGupta_2015X,i wore these already for five years until i moved out of that town <unk>
3179_AditiGupta_2015X,another issue that periods brought in my life those of the social restrictions
3180_AditiGupta_2015X,that are imposed upon our girls girls and women when they 're on their periods <unk> i think you all must be aware of it
3181_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> list it for the few who don 't <unk>
3182_AditiGupta_2015X,i was not allowed to touch or eat pickles <unk>

3184_AditiGupta_2015X,i was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any
3185_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> object of religious importance you 'll find signposts outside temples denying the entry of menstruating girls and women
3186_AditiGupta_2015X,ironically most of the time it is the older woman who imposes such restrictions on younger girls
3187_AditiGupta_2015X,in a family after all they have grown up accepting such restrictions as norms <unk> and in the absence of any intervention
3188_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> it is the myth and misconception that propagate from generation to generation
3189_AditiGupta_2015X,during my years of work in this field i have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes separately
3190_AditiGupta_2015X,they 're not allowed to take baths during periods <unk> and in some households they are even secluded from other family members
3191_AditiGupta_2015X,about eighty five percent of girls and women in india would follow one or more restrictive customs on their periods
3192_AditiGupta_2015X,every month
3193_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> can you imagine what this does to the <unk>

3197_AditiGupta_2015X,i religiously followed all these restrictive customs for thirteen years until a discussion with my
3198_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> partner tuhin changed my perception about menstruation forever in two thousand and nine tuhin and i were pursuing
3199_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> in design we fell in love with each other and i was at ease discussing periods with him tuhin knew little about periods

3201_AditiGupta_2015X,yeah <unk>
3202_AditiGupta_2015X,he was completely shocked to know about the restrictions that are imposed upon menstruating girls menstruating girls and women by their own families and their society
3203_AditiGupta_2015X,in order to help me with my cramps he would go on the
3204_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> internet and learn more about menstruation when he shared his findings with me i realized how little i knew about menstruation myself <unk>
3205_AditiGupta_2015X,and many of my beliefs actually turned out to be myths
3206_AditiGupta_2015X,that 's when we wondered <unk> if we being so well educated were so ill informed about menstruation there would be millions of girls out there
3207_AditiGupta_2015X,who would be ill informed too to study to understand the problem better i undertook a year long research to
3208_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> the lack of awareness about menstruation and the root cause behind it <unk> while it is generally believed that menstrual
3209_AditiGupta_2015X,and misconception is a rural phenomenon during my research <unk> i found that it is as much an urban phenomenon as well <unk> and it exists with
3210_AditiGupta_2015X,the educated urban
3211_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> while talking to many parents and teachers <unk> i found that many of them actually wanted to educate girls about <unk>
3212_AditiGupta_2015X,before they have started getting their menstrual cycle <unk> and
3213_AditiGupta_2015X,but they lacked the proper means themselves <unk> and since it is a taboo <unk> they feel inhibition and shameful in talking about it <unk>
3214_AditiGupta_2015X,girls nowadays
3215_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> get their periods in classes six and seven <unk> but our educational curriculum teaches girls about periods only in standard eight and nine <unk>

3217_AditiGupta_2015X,school does not teach girls about periods <unk> parents don 't talk about it <unk> where do the girls go two decades ago
3218_AditiGupta_2015X,and now
3219_AditiGupta_2015X,nothing has changed
3220_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> changed
3221_AditiGupta_2015X,i shared these finding with tuhin and we wondered what if we could create something that would help girls understand about menstruation on their own
3222_AditiGupta_2015X,something that would help parents and teachers talk about periods comfortably to young girls
3223_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> i was collecting a lot of stories these were stories of experiences of girls
3224_AditiGupta_2015X,during their periods <unk> these stories would make girls curious and interested in
3225_AditiGupta_2015X,talking about menstruation in their close circle that 's what we wanted <unk> we wanted something that would
3226_AditiGupta_2015X,make the girls curious and drive them to learn about it <unk> we wanted to use these stories to teach girls about periods <unk>
3227_AditiGupta_2015X,so we decided to create a comic book
3228_AditiGupta_2015X,where the cartoon characters would enact these stories and educate girls about menstruation in a fun and engaging way
3229_AditiGupta_2015X,to represent girls in their different phases of puberty we have three characters
3230_AditiGupta_2015X,pinki who has not gotten her period yet <unk> jiya who gets her period during the narrative of the book
3231_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> there is a fourth character priya didi through her girls come to know about the various aspects of growing up and menstrual hygiene management <unk>
3232_AditiGupta_2015X,while making the book we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way and that it is culturally sensitive <unk>
3233_AditiGupta_2015X,during our prototype testing we found that the girls loved the book <unk> they were keen on reading it and knowing more and more about
3234_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> parents and teachers were comfortable in talking about periods to young girls using the book and sometimes even boys were interested in reading it
3235_AditiGupta_2015X,the comic book helped in creating an environment where menstruation ceased to be a taboo
3236_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> many of the volunteers took this prototype themselves to educate girls and take menstrual awareness workshops in five different states in india and one of the volunteers took this prototype <unk>
3237_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> to educate young monks and took it to this monastery in ladakh <unk> we made the final version of the book called menstrupedia comic and launched in september last year <unk>
3238_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> and ten different countries <unk> we are constantly translating the book into different languages and collaborating with
3239_AditiGupta_2015X,local organizations to make this book available in different countries <unk> fifteen schools in different parts of india have
3240_AditiGupta_2015X,made this book a part of their school curriculum to teach girls about
3241_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> menstruation
3242_AditiGupta_2015X,i am amazed to see how
3243_AditiGupta_2015X,volunteers <unk> individuals parents teachers school principals <unk> have come together
3244_AditiGupta_2015X,and taken this menstrual awareness drive to their own communities have made sure that the girls learn about
3245_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> periods at the right age and helped in breaking this taboo <unk>
3246_AditiGupta_2015X,i dream of a future where menstruation is not a curse
3247_AditiGupta_2015X,not a disease <unk> but a welcoming change in a girl 's life <unk>
3248_AditiGupta_2015X,and i would

3250_AditiGupta_2015X,dear parents if you would be ashamed of periods <unk> your daughters would be too so please be period positive
3251_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> when i was ten years old a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school and as a special treat he took me to the pathology lab
3252_AditiGupta_2015X,and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands <unk> and there it was
3253_AditiGupta_2015X,seat of human consciousness the powerhouse of the human body <unk> sitting in my hands <unk>
3254_AditiGupta_2015X,and that day i knew that when i grew up i was going to become a brain doctor scientist something or the other <unk>
3255_AditiGupta_2015X,years later when i finally grew up my dream came true and it was while
3256_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that i encountered a startling fact that i 'd like to share with you all today
3257_AditiGupta_2015X,it is estimated that one in six children that 's one in six children <unk> suffer from some developmental disorder
3258_AditiGupta_2015X,this is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes
3259_AditiGupta_2015X,<unk> which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder <unk>
3260_AditiShankardass_2009I,but here 's what really perplexed me <unk>
3261_AditiShankardass_2009I,despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain
3262_AditiShankardass_2009I,most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis
3263_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> but diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms without
3264_AditiShankardass_2009I,even doing an ecg or a chest x ray to look at the heart
3265_AditiShankardass_2009I,it seemed so intuitive to me
3266_AditiShankardass_2009I,to diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately <unk> it would be necessary to look at the brain directly
3267_AditiShankardass_2009I,looking at behavior alone can miss
3268_AditiShankardass_2009I,a vital piece of the puzzle
3269_AditiShankardass_2009I,and provide an incomplete or even a misleading picture of the child 's problems <unk>
3270_AditiShankardass_2009I,yet despite all the advances in medical technology
3271_AditiShankardass_2009I,the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited
3272_AditiShankardass_2009I,and then i came across a team at harvard university that had taken one such advanced medical
3273_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> technology and finally applied it instead of in brain research towards diagnosing brain disorders in children
3274_AditiShankardass_2009I,their groundbreaking technology records the eeg or the electrical activity of the brain in real time <unk>
3275_AditiShankardass_2009I,allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions
3276_AditiShankardass_2009I,and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions
3277_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> vision attention language <unk> audition
3278_AditiShankardass_2009I,a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain
3279_AditiShankardass_2009I,and another program called statistical probability mapping
3280_AditiShankardass_2009I,then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant <unk> allowing us to provide a much more accurate
3281_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> neurological diagnosis of the child 's symptoms <unk> and so i became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team
3282_AditiShankardass_2009I,and we 're finally able to use this technology towards
3283_AditiShankardass_2009I,actually helping children with brain disorders and i 'm happy to say that i 'm now in the process of setting up this technology here in india
3284_AditiShankardass_2009I,i 'd like to tell you about one such child whose story was also covered by
3285_AditiShankardass_2009I,seven year old justin senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism <unk>
3286_AditiShankardass_2009I,like many autistic children his mind was locked inside his body <unk>
3287_AditiShankardass_2009I,there were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time
3288_AditiShankardass_2009I,and the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially <unk> and he would
3289_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> probably never have too much language
3290_AditiShankardass_2009I,when we used this groundbreaking eeg technology to actually look at justin 's brain the results were startling
3291_AditiShankardass_2009I,it turned out that justin was almost certainly not autistic he was suffering from brain seizures
3292_AditiShankardass_2009I,that were impossible to see with the naked eye <unk> but that were actually causing symptoms that
3293_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> mimicked those of autism <unk>
3294_AditiShankardass_2009I,after justin was given anti seizure medication the change in him was amazing <unk>
3295_AditiShankardass_2009I,within a period of sixty days his vocabulary went from two to three words to three hundred words <unk>
3296_AditiShankardass_2009I,and his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ
3297_AditiShankardass_2009I,research shows that fifty percent of children <unk> almost fifty percent of children diagnosed with autism
3298_AditiShankardass_2009I,are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures these are the faces of the children that i have tested
3299_AditiShankardass_2009I,with stories just like justin all
3300_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism attention deficit disorder mental retardation language problems
3301_AditiShankardass_2009I,instead our eeg scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn 't possibly have been detected by their behavioral
3302_AditiShankardass_2009I,assessments so these eeg scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis
3303_AditiShankardass_2009I,and much more targeted
3304_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> treatment
3305_AditiShankardass_2009I,for too long now children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen <unk>
3306_AditiShankardass_2009I,and for too long these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation <unk>
3307_AditiShankardass_2009I,but we are now in a new era of neuroscience
3308_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects
3309_AditiShankardass_2009I,and find the true source of so many disabilities in children
3310_AditiShankardass_2009I,so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder
3311_AditiShankardass_2009I,then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be
3312_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> solved one more mind will be unlocked <unk> and one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system
3313_AditiShankardass_2009I,will finally realize his or her true potential while there 's still time for his or her brain to recover <unk>
3314_AditiShankardass_2009I,and all this by simply watching the child 's brainwaves
3315_AditiShankardass_2009I,<unk> to start with a question when was the last time you were called childish for kids like me being called childish can be a frequent occurrence <unk> every time we <unk>

3326_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> that won 't benefit me
3327_AdoraSvitak_2010,for better or worse we kids aren 't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things
3328_AdoraSvitak_2010,kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were free a kind of utopia <unk>
3329_AdoraSvitak_2010,how many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities <unk>
3330_AdoraSvitak_2010,sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals
3331_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> be a burden <unk> because you know that if everything were free then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos
3332_AdoraSvitak_2010,on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection
3333_AdoraSvitak_2010,and that 's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first
3334_AdoraSvitak_2010,in many ways <unk> our audacity to imagine
3335_AdoraSvitak_2010,imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the museum of glass in tacoma washington my home state yoohoo washington
3336_AdoraSvitak_2010,has a program called kids design glass and kids draw their own ideas for glass art the resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from <unk>
3337_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> the program because kids don 't think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes they just think of good ideas <unk>
3338_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> or maybe italian vases <unk> but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys
3339_AdoraSvitak_2010,who you can see has meat vision
3340_AdoraSvitak_2010,now <unk> our inherent wisdom doesn 't have to be insider 's knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults
3341_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> we have a lot to share i think that adults should start learning from kids now
3342_AdoraSvitak_2010,i do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd teachers and students and i like this analogy it shouldn 't be a teacher at the head of the class <unk> telling students do this do that
3343_AdoraSvitak_2010,the students should teach their teachers
3344_AdoraSvitak_2010,learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal <unk>
3345_AdoraSvitak_2010,the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it now if you don 't trust someone you place
3346_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> restrictions on them right if i doubt my older sister 's ability to pay back the ten percent interest i established on her last loan i 'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back

3348_AdoraSvitak_2010,adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards
3349_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> don 't do that don 't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use
3350_AdoraSvitak_2010,as history points out regimes become oppressive when they 're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes <unk>
3351_AdoraSvitak_2010,kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population
3352_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> often underestimate kids ' abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sink to them <unk>
3353_AdoraSvitak_2010,my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister
3354_AdoraSvitak_2010,okay so they didn 't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that
3355_AdoraSvitak_2010,but my dad did read to us about aristotle and pioneer
3356_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round well we heard that one too but pioneer germ fighters totally rules

3359_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> i wanted to get published <unk>
3360_AdoraSvitak_2010,instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you 're older my parents were really supportive
3361_AdoraSvitak_2010,many publishers were not quite so encouraging
3362_AdoraSvitak_2010,one large children 's publisher ironically said that they didn 't work with children children 's publisher not working with children
3363_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> one publisher action publishing was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what i had to say they published my first book flying fingers you see it here <unk>
3364_AdoraSvitak_2010,and from there on it 's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools keynoting to thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you i appreciate your attention
3365_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> because to show that you truly care you listen
3366_AdoraSvitak_2010,but there 's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults
3367_AdoraSvitak_2010,kids grow up and become adults just like you
3368_AdoraSvitak_2010,or just like you really <unk> the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenging
3369_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones it 's the reason we 're not in the dark ages anymore <unk>
3370_AdoraSvitak_2010,no matter your position or place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away

3375_AdoraSvitak_2010,<unk> again in which case you 'll want to be heard just like my generation <unk> now <unk> the world needs opportunities

3384_AdoraSvitak_2010,the first thing is that the big myth number one
3385_AdoraSvitak_2010,is that in fact it 's not

3389_AfraRaymond_2012X,when the commissioner of police comes on tv to talk about crime he isn 't speaking about corruption and we know for sure when the minister of national security is speaking about crime he 's not
3390_AfraRaymond_2012X,talking about corruption either <unk>
3391_AfraRaymond_2012X,the point i 'm making is that it is a crime
3392_AfraRaymond_2012X,it is an economic crime <unk> because we 're involving the looting of taxpayers ' money
3393_AfraRaymond_2012X,public and private corruption is a reality as somebody who comes from the private sector i can tell you there 's a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government the same bribes <unk>

3398_AfraRaymond_2012X,corruption is only a small problem if it is a problem it 's only a small problem <unk>
3399_AfraRaymond_2012X,that in fact it 's only a little ten or fifteen percent <unk> it 's been going on forever <unk> it probably will
3400_AfraRaymond_2012X,<unk> continue forever <unk> and there 's no point passing any laws because there 's little we can do about it <unk> and i want to demonstrate that that too
3401_AfraRaymond_2012X,is a dangerous myth very dangerous it 's a piece of public mischief <unk>

3409_AfraRaymond_2012X,okay
3410_AfraRaymond_2012X,the first thing i want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about forty years ago <unk>
3411_AfraRaymond_2012X,we embarked the government of the day embarked on a series of
3412_AfraRaymond_2012X,and some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government to government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world the united states and britain and france and so on and so on
3413_AfraRaymond_2012X,<unk> as i said even this building we 're standing in that 's one of the ironies this building was part of that series of complexes what they called the twin towers <unk>
3414_AfraRaymond_2012X,it became so outrageous the whole situation that in fact a commission of inquiry was
3415_AfraRaymond_2012X,and it reported in <unk>

3418_AfraRaymond_2012X,they went right in here i was a young man at the time it went right into my heart <unk> and he said that in fact
3419_AfraRaymond_2012X,let me see if this thing works are we getting

3421_AfraRaymond_2012X,two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent the taxpayers ' money was wasted or stolen

3426_AfraRaymond_2012X,i don 't like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience but i have to
3427_AfraRaymond_2012X,four months ago we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country <unk>
3428_AfraRaymond_2012X,we call it the section

3434_AfraRaymond_2012X,most importantly the american embassy complained <unk>
3435_AfraRaymond_2012X,so parliament was swiftly reconvened and the law was reversed it was repealed that 's the word lawyers use it was repealed
3436_AfraRaymond_2012X,but the point is
3437_AfraRaymond_2012X,that parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events <unk> because what really happened
3438_AfraRaymond_2012X,is that because of the suspicious passage of that law the law was actually passed into effect
3439_AfraRaymond_2012X,on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence our jubilee of independence <unk>
3440_AfraRaymond_2012X,<unk> that is the kind of outrage of the thing it was kind of a nasty way to get maturation but we got it <unk> because we all understood it <unk> and for the first time that i could remember

3451_AfraRaymond_2012X,and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing we can look at this second slide here
3452_AfraRaymond_2012X,and what we have here i am not saying so

3521_AfraRaymond_2012X,and the most famous case
3522_AfraRaymond_2012X,was what we came to call the secret scholarship scandal

3528_AfraRaymond_2012X,<unk> the question is this if it 's right and proper for us to use the freedom of information act and to use the court

3530_AfraRaymond_2012X,it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about twenty four billion dollars

3732_AimeeMullins_2009U,was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community
3733_AimeeMullins_2009U,to come bring their talent to the science and to the art
3734_AimeeMullins_2009U,of building legs so that we can stop compartmentalizing form <unk> function and aesthetic and assigning them different values well
3735_AimeeMullins_2009U,lucky for me a lot of people answered that call <unk>
3736_AimeeMullins_2009U,and the journey started funny enough with
3737_AimeeMullins_2009U,a ted conference attendee chee pearlman who
3738_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> hopefully is in the audience somewhere today she was the editor then of a magazine called id <unk>
3739_AimeeMullins_2009U,and she gave me a cover story
3740_AimeeMullins_2009U,this started an incredible journey curious encounters were happening to me at the time i 'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak
3741_AimeeMullins_2009U,on the design of the cheetah legs around the world and
3742_AimeeMullins_2009U,people would come up to me after the conference after my talk men and women <unk> and the conversation would go
3743_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> like this you know aimee <unk> you 're very attractive you don 't look disabled
3744_AimeeMullins_2009U,i thought well that 's amazing because i don 't feel disabled and it really opened my eyes to
3745_AimeeMullins_2009U,this conversation that could be explored about beauty what does a beautiful woman have
3746_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> a sexy body and
3747_AimeeMullins_2009U,interestingly from an identity standpoint what does it mean to have a disability <unk>
3748_AimeeMullins_2009U,i mean people pamela anderson has more prosthetic in her body than i do <unk> nobody calls her disabled
3749_AimeeMullins_2009U,so this magazine through the hands of graphic designer peter saville went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen and photographer nick knight who were also interested in exploring that
3750_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> conversation so three months after ted i found myself on a plane to london doing my first fashion shoot <unk> which resulted in this cover <unk>
3751_AimeeMullins_2009U,three months after that i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen
3752_AimeeMullins_2009U,on a pair of hand carved wooden legs made from solid ash <unk> nobody knew everyone thought they were wooden boots actually i have them
3753_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> on stage with me <unk> grapevines <unk> magnolias truly stunning <unk> poetry
3754_AimeeMullins_2009U,matters <unk> poetry is what elevates the banal
3755_AimeeMullins_2009U,and neglected object to a realm of art it can transform
3756_AimeeMullins_2009U,the thing that
3757_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> might have
3758_AimeeMullins_2009U,made people fearful
3759_AimeeMullins_2009U,into something that invites them to look and look a little longer <unk> and maybe even understand <unk>
3760_AimeeMullins_2009U,i learned this firsthand with my next adventure the artist matthew barney in his film opus called the the cremaster cycle
3761_AimeeMullins_2009U,this is where it really hit home for me that my legs could be wearable sculpture and even at this point <unk> i started to move away from the need to replicate
3762_AimeeMullins_2009U,as the only aesthetic ideal <unk> so we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they 're
3763_AimeeMullins_2009U,actually optically clear polyurethane a k a bowling ball material heavy then we made these legs that are cast in soil
3764_AimeeMullins_2009U,with a potato root system growing in them and beetroots out the top and a very lovely brass
3765_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> little homage to my
3766_AimeeMullins_2009U,life as an athlete fourteen hours of prosthetic make up to get into a creature that had articulated paws <unk> claws
3767_AimeeMullins_2009U,and a tail that whipped around like a gecko
3768_AimeeMullins_2009U,and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these look like jellyfish legs also polyurethane
3769_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> and the only purpose that these legs can serve outside the context of the film is
3770_AimeeMullins_2009U,to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination so whimsy
3771_AimeeMullins_2009U,matters <unk> today <unk> i have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me
3772_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> and with them i have different negotiations
3773_AimeeMullins_2009U,of the terrain under my feet and i can change my height i have a variable of five different heights today i 'm six ' one
3774_AimeeMullins_2009U,and i had these legs made a little over a year ago at dorset orthopedic in england and when i brought them home to manhattan my first night out on the town i went to a very fancy party
3775_AimeeMullins_2009U,and a girl was there who has known me for years at my
3776_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts but i have an entirely new relationship to door jams that i never expected i would ever have <unk> and
3777_AimeeMullins_2009U,i was having fun with it <unk> and she looked at me and she said but aimee that 's not fair
3778_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> really meant it it 's not fair that you can change your height as you want it
3779_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> the need to replicate
3780_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> i make technologies to help them communicate
3781_AimeeMullins_2009U,now many of the problems that children with autism face <unk> they have a common source and
3782_AimeeMullins_2009U,that source is that they find it difficult to understand abstraction
3783_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> symbolism and because of this they have a lot of difficulty with language <unk> let me tell you
3784_AimeeMullins_2009U,a little bit about why this is <unk> you see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup all of us can see it all of us understand this
3785_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> these are two other pictures of soup but you can see that these are more abstract these are not quite as concrete and when you get to language
3786_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> see that it becomes a word
3787_AimeeMullins_2009U,whose look the way it looks and the way it sounds has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with or what it represents which is the bowl of soup
3788_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> so it 's essentially a completely abstract a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world <unk> and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount
3789_AimeeMullins_2009U,<unk> now that 's why most of the people that work with children with autism speech therapists educators
3790_AimeeMullins_2009U,what they do is they try to help children with autism communicate not with words but with pictures so if a child with autism wanted to say i want soup
3791_AjitNarayanan_2013,that child would pick three different pictures i want and soup and they would put these together and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say <unk>
3792_AjitNarayanan_2013,and this has been incredibly effective for the last thirty forty years
3793_AjitNarayanan_2013,people have been doing this
3794_AjitNarayanan_2013,in fact a few years back i developed an app for the ipad
3795_AjitNarayanan_2013,which does exactly this it 's called avaz and the way it works is that kids select different pictures these pictures are sequenced together to form sentences
3796_AjitNarayanan_2013,and these sentences are spoken out so avaz is essentially converting pictures <unk> it 's a translator it converts pictures into speech
3797_AjitNarayanan_2013,now this was very effective there are thousands of children using this
3798_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> the world <unk> and i started thinking about
3799_AjitNarayanan_2013,what it does and what it doesn 't do and i realized something interesting avaz helps children with autism learn words
3800_AjitNarayanan_2013,what it doesn 't help them do is to learn
3801_AjitNarayanan_2013,word patterns <unk> let me explain this in a little more detail <unk> take this sentence
3802_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> it 's not just the words here that convey the meaning <unk> it 's also the way in which these words are arranged the way these words are modified and arranged <unk> and that 's why a sentence like <unk>
3803_AjitNarayanan_2013,i want soup tonight is different from a sentence like soup want i tonight which is completely meaningless
3804_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and that 's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings to convey different ideas <unk>
3805_AjitNarayanan_2013,now this is what we call grammar
3806_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and grammar is incredibly powerful because grammar is this one component of language which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have
3807_AjitNarayanan_2013,and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information
3808_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> infinite amount of ideas <unk> it 's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to and so after <unk>
3809_AjitNarayanan_2013,i worried for a very long time about how i could give grammar to children with autism <unk> the solution came to me from a very interesting perspective <unk> i happened to
3810_AjitNarayanan_2013,chance upon a child with autism conversing with
3811_AjitNarayanan_2013,with her mom <unk> and this is what happened completely out of
3812_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> what was interesting was the way in which the mom was trying to tease out the meaning of what the child wanted to say by talking to her in questions so <unk>
3813_AjitNarayanan_2013,she asked eat what do you want to eat ice cream you want to eat <unk> somebody else wants to eat you want to eat cream now you want to eat ice cream in the evening
3814_AjitNarayanan_2013,and it struck me that maybe this is what i was looking for instead of arranging words in an order <unk> in sequence as a sentence <unk>
3815_AjitNarayanan_2013,you arrange them in this map where they 're all linked together
3816_AjitNarayanan_2013,not by placing them one one after the other but in questions in question answer
3817_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and so if you do this then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in english but what you 're conveying is really
3818_AjitNarayanan_2013,a meaning the meaning of a sentence in english <unk> now meaning is really the underbelly in some sense of language it 's what comes after thought but before language
3819_AjitNarayanan_2013,and the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form
3820_AjitNarayanan_2013,so i was very excited by this you know hopping around all over the place trying to figure out if i can convert all possible sentences that i hear
3821_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> this <unk> and i found that this is not enough why is this not enough this is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation <unk> you want to say i don 't want soup
3822_AjitNarayanan_2013,then you can 't do that by asking a question you do that by changing the word want
3823_AjitNarayanan_2013,again if you wanted to say i wanted soup yesterday you do that by converting the word want into
3824_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> it 's a past tense <unk> so this is a flourish which i added to make the system complete <unk> this is a map of words joined together as questions and answers
3825_AjitNarayanan_2013,and with these filters applied on top of them in order to modify them to represent certain nuances <unk>
3826_AjitNarayanan_2013,let me show you this with a different example <unk> let 's take this sentence i told the carpenter i could not pay him it 's a fairly complicated sentence
3827_AjitNarayanan_2013,the way that this particular system works you can start with any part of this sentence i 'm going to start with the word
3828_AjitNarayanan_2013,this happened in the past so i 'm going to make that told
3829_AjitNarayanan_2013,now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to ask questions <unk> so who told <unk> i told i told whom i told the carpenter <unk>
3830_AjitNarayanan_2013,now we start with a different part of the sentence we start with the word pay and we add the ability filter to it to make it can pay then we make it
3831_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and we can make it couldn 't pay by making it the past tense <unk> so who couldn 't pay <unk> i couldn 't pay <unk> couldn 't pay whom <unk> i couldn 't pay the carpenter
3832_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and then you join these two together by asking this question what did i tell the carpenter
3833_AjitNarayanan_2013,i told the carpenter i could not pay him <unk>
3834_AjitNarayanan_2013,now think about this <unk> this is
3835_AjitNarayanan_2013,this is a representation
3836_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and there are two or three interesting things about this first of all
3837_AjitNarayanan_2013,i could have started anywhere
3838_AjitNarayanan_2013,i didn 't have to start with the word tell i could have started anywhere in the sentence and i could have made this entire thing
3839_AjitNarayanan_2013,the second thing is if i wasn 't an english speaker if i was speaking in some other language <unk> this map would actually hold true in any language <unk>
3840_AjitNarayanan_2013,so long as the questions are standardized the map is actually independent of language
3841_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> so i call this freespeech and
3842_AjitNarayanan_2013,i was playing with this for many many months i was trying out so many different combinations of this
3843_AjitNarayanan_2013,and then i noticed something very interesting about freespeech
3844_AjitNarayanan_2013,i was trying to convert language <unk> convert sentences in english into sentences in freespeech and vice versa and back and forth <unk>
3845_AjitNarayanan_2013,and i realized that this particular configuration this particular way of representing language <unk> it allowed me to actually create very concise
3846_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> rules
3847_AjitNarayanan_2013,that go between freespeech on one side and english on the other <unk> so i could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into english <unk> and so i developed this thing i developed this thing called the freespeech engine which takes any <unk>
3848_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> the input and gives out perfectly grammatical english text and by putting these two pieces together the representation and the engine
3849_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> was able to create
3850_AjitNarayanan_2013,an app a technology for children with autism that not only gives them words but also gives them grammar
3851_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> so i tried this out with kids with with autism and i found that there was an incredible amount of
3852_AjitNarayanan_2013,identification they <unk>
3853_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> were able to create sentences in freespeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in
3854_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> english <unk> and i started thinking about why that might be the case <unk>
3855_AjitNarayanan_2013,and i had an idea and i want to talk to you about this idea next
3856_AjitNarayanan_2013,in about one thousand
3857_AjitNarayanan_2013,nine hundred and ninety seven about fifteen years back <unk> there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language and they found something very interesting they found that when you learn a language as a as a
3858_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> you learn it with a certain part of your brain <unk> and when you learn a language as an adult for example if i wanted to learn japanese right now
3859_AjitNarayanan_2013,a completely different part of my brain is used <unk> now i don 't know why that 's the case but
3860_AjitNarayanan_2013,my guess is that that 's because when you learn a language as an adult you almost invariably learn it through
3861_AjitNarayanan_2013,your native language or through your first language <unk> so what 's interesting about freespeech is that when you create a
3862_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> sentence or when you create language <unk> a child with autism creates language with freespeech
3863_AjitNarayanan_2013,they 're not using this support language they 're not using this bridge language <unk> they 're directly constructing the sentence <unk>
3864_AjitNarayanan_2013,and so this this gave me this idea is it possible to use freespeech not for children with autism
3865_AjitNarayanan_2013,but to teach language
3866_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and so i tried a number of experiments <unk> the first thing i did was i built
3867_AjitNarayanan_2013,a jigsaw puzzle in which these these questions and answers are coded in the form of of shapes in the form of colors <unk> and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works <unk>
3868_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and i built an app out of it a game out of it in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement a sound reinforcement of visual structures <unk> they 're able to learn language
3869_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> this <unk> this has a lot of potential a lot of promise and the government of india recently licensed this technology from us and they 're going to try it out with millions of different children
3870_AjitNarayanan_2013,trying to teach them english <unk>
3871_AjitNarayanan_2013,and the dream <unk> the hope <unk> the vision really is that when they learn english this way they learn it with the same proficiency as their mother tongue
3872_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> let 's talk about speech <unk> this is speech so speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us <unk> now what 's interesting about speech is that speech is <unk>
3873_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> one dimensional because it 's sound it 's also one dimensional because our mouths are built that way our mouths are built to create one dimensional sound
3874_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> if you think about the brain the thoughts that we have in our heads
3875_AjitNarayanan_2013,are not one dimensional i mean we have these rich <unk> complicated <unk> multi dimensional ideas <unk>
3876_AjitNarayanan_2013,now it seems to me that language is really the brain 's invention
3877_AjitNarayanan_2013,to convert this rich multi dimensional thought on one hand
3878_AjitNarayanan_2013,into speech on the other hand <unk> now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays and almost all of that is done in the language domain
3879_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> take google for example google trawls all these countless billions of websites all of which are in english <unk> and when you want to use google you go into google search and you type in english <unk>
3880_AjitNarayanan_2013,and it matches the english with the english <unk>
3881_AjitNarayanan_2013,what if we could do this in freespeech instead
3882_AjitNarayanan_2013,i have a suspicion that if we did this we 'd find that algorithms like searching like retrieval all of these things
3883_AjitNarayanan_2013,are much simpler
3884_AjitNarayanan_2013,and also more effective <unk> because they don 't process the data structure of speech <unk>
3885_AjitNarayanan_2013,instead they 're processing the data structure of thought
3886_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> the data structure of thought that 's a provocative idea but let 's look at this in a little more detail <unk> so this is the
3887_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> we have the free speech representation
3888_AjitNarayanan_2013,on one side
3889_AjitNarayanan_2013,and we have the freespeech engine which generates english <unk> now if you think about it freespeech i told you is completely language independent it doesn 't have any specific information in it which is about english <unk> so everything that this system knows about english is actually encoded
3890_AjitNarayanan_2013,into the engine
3891_AjitNarayanan_2013,that 's a pretty pretty interesting concept in itself <unk> you 've encoded an entire human language into a software program
3892_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> but
3893_AjitNarayanan_2013,if you look at what 's inside the engine it 's actually not very complicated <unk> it 's not very complicated code and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really <unk>
3894_AjitNarayanan_2013,and that gives this interesting idea <unk> it might be very easy for us to actually create these engines
3895_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and that gives another interesting idea for example supposing i was a writer say for a newspaper or for a magazine
3896_AjitNarayanan_2013,i could create content in one language freespeech
3897_AjitNarayanan_2013,and the person who 's consuming that content the person who 's who 's reading that that particular information
3898_AjitNarayanan_2013,could choose any engine <unk> and they could read it in
3899_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> their own mother tongue <unk> in their native language i mean
3900_AjitNarayanan_2013,this is an incredibly attractive idea especially for india <unk>
3901_AjitNarayanan_2013,we have so many different languages there 's a song about india and there 's a description of of the country as
3902_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> language is beautiful <unk> i think it 's the most beautiful of of human creations <unk> i think it 's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented it entertains <unk> it educates it enlightens <unk>
3903_AjitNarayanan_2013,but what i like the most about language is that it empowers <unk> i want to leave you with this this
3904_AjitNarayanan_2013,is a photograph of of my collaborators my earliest collaborators when i started working on language and autism and various other things
3905_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> the girl 's name is pavna and that 's her mother kalpana and pavna 's an entrepreneur <unk> but her story is much more remarkable than mine because pavna is about
3906_AjitNarayanan_2013,twenty three she has quadriplegic cerebral palsy so ever since she was born she could neither move
3907_AjitNarayanan_2013,nor talk and everything that she 's accomplished so far <unk>
3908_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> starting a company <unk> collaborating with me to develop avaz all of these things she 's done with nothing more
3909_AjitNarayanan_2013,than moving her eyes
3910_AjitNarayanan_2013,daniel webster said this he said
3911_AjitNarayanan_2013,if all of my possessions were taken from me with one exception <unk>
3912_AjitNarayanan_2013,i would choose to keep the power of communication
3913_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> that 's closest to my heart still remains
3914_AjitNarayanan_2013,the ability for this to empower children with disabilities to be able to communicate the power of communication to get back all the rest
3915_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> it 's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice i 'm extremely grateful i have been blown away
3916_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> and i want to thank all of you for the the many
3917_AjitNarayanan_2013,nice comments about what i had to say the the other night <unk> and i say that sincerely <unk>
3918_AjitNarayanan_2013,partly because i need that
3919_AjitNarayanan_2013,put yourselves in my position
3920_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> i flew on air force two for eight years
3921_AjitNarayanan_2013,now i have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane i 'll
3922_AjitNarayanan_2013,tell you one quick story to illustrate what that 's been like for me
3923_AjitNarayanan_2013,<unk> every bit of this is true <unk> soon after tipper and i left the white house
3924_AjitNarayanan_2013,we were driving from our home in nashville to a little farm we have fifty miles east of nashville <unk>
3925_AjitNarayanan_2013,driving ourselves
3926_AlGore_2006,i know it sounds like a little thing to you but
3927_AlGore_2006,i looked in the rear view mirror and
3928_AlGore_2006,all of a sudden it just hit me <unk> there was no motorcade back there
3929_AlGore_2006,you 've heard of phantom limb pain
3930_AlGore_2006,<unk> this was a rented ford taurus
3931_AlGore_2006,laughter it was dinnertime <unk> and we started looking for a place to eat
3932_AlGore_2006,we were on i 40 we got to
3933_AlGore_2006,exit two hundred and thirty eight lebanon tennessee we got off the exit we found a shoney 's restaurant
3934_AlGore_2006,low cost family restaurant chain for those of you who don 't know it
3935_AlGore_2006,<unk> sat down at the booth and the waitress came over made a big commotion over tipper
3936_AlGore_2006,she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she
3937_AlGore_2006,lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying and she said yes that 's former vice president al gore and his wife tipper
3938_AlGore_2006,<unk> 's been kind of a series of epiphanies the very next day continuing the totally true story i got on a

3947_AlGore_2006,laughter but what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely
3948_AlGore_2006,upset because one of the wire services
3949_AlGore_2006,in nigeria had already written a story about my speech <unk> and it had already been printed in cities all across the united states
3950_AlGore_2006,of america it was printed in monterey
3951_AlGore_2006,<unk> i checked laughter

3961_AlGore_2006,<unk> i want to focus
3962_AlGore_2006,on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on what can you do
3963_AlGore_2006,about the climate crisis <unk> i want to start with a couple of
3964_AlGore_2006,i 'm going to show some new images <unk> and i 'm going to
3965_AlGore_2006,<unk> i update the slide show
3966_AlGore_2006,every time i give it i add new images because i learn more about it every time i give it it
3967_AlGore_2006,'s like beach combing you know every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells just in the last two days <unk> we got the new

3971_AlGore_2006,i 'm kidding <unk> but these are the recapitulation slides and then i 'm going to go into new material about what you can do <unk> but i wanted to elaborate on a
3972_AlGore_2006,couple of these
3973_AlGore_2006,first of all this is where we 're projected to go with the u s contribution to global warming <unk> under business as usual
3974_AlGore_2006,efficiency in in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit efficiency and conservation
3975_AlGore_2006,it 's not a cost it 's a profit the sign is wrong
3976_AlGore_2006,it 's not negative it 's positive these are investments that pay for themselves but they are also very effective
3977_AlGore_2006,<unk> in deflecting our path
3978_AlGore_2006,cars and trucks i talked about that in the slideshow <unk> but i want you to put it in perspective
3979_AlGore_2006,<unk> it 's an easy visible
3980_AlGore_2006,target of concern and it should be but
3981_AlGore_2006,there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks cars and trucks are very significant
3982_AlGore_2006,and we have the lowest standards in the world and so we should address that but it 's part of the puzzle
3983_AlGore_2006,other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks <unk>
3984_AlGore_2006,renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference and with what vinod and
3985_AlGore_2006,<unk> john doerr and others many of you here there are a lot of people directly involved in this this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it
3986_AlGore_2006,carbon capture and sequestration that 's what ccs
3987_AlGore_2006,stands for is likely to become the killer app
3988_AlGore_2006,that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe
3989_AlGore_2006,not quite there yet <unk> ok now <unk> what can you do
3990_AlGore_2006,reduce emissions in your home most of these
3991_AlGore_2006,expenditures are also profitable
3992_AlGore_2006,insulation better design buy green electricity where where you can i mentioned automobiles
3993_AlGore_2006,buy a hybrid
3994_AlGore_2006,use light rail <unk> figure out some of the other options that are much better it 's important
3995_AlGore_2006,be a green consumer you have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh
3996_AlGore_2006,effect or a much less harsh effect
3997_AlGore_2006,on the on the global

4002_AlGore_2006,a lot of us
4003_AlGore_2006,<unk> in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy it means reduce your carbon
4004_AlGore_2006,dioxide emissions
4005_AlGore_2006,with the full range of choices that you make
4006_AlGore_2006,and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced
4007_AlGore_2006,and what what it means is elaborated
4008_AlGore_2006,<unk> calculator <unk> participant productions convened
4009_AlGore_2006,with my active involvement the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a
4010_AlGore_2006,<unk> you will be given options to reduce and
4011_AlGore_2006,by the time the movie comes out in may <unk> this will be updated to two point zero and we will have <unk> click through purchases of offsets
4012_AlGore_2006,next consider making your business <unk>
4013_AlGore_2006,again some of us have done that and it 's not as hard as you think <unk> integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations whether you
4014_AlGore_2006,<unk> are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community invest sustainably <unk> majora mentioned this
4015_AlGore_2006,listen if you
4016_AlGore_2006,have invested money

4023_AlGore_2006,the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago except it 's a lot more entertaining <unk>

4031_AlGore_2006,working with larry lessig <unk> it will be somewhere in that process posted with tools and <unk> limited use
4032_AlGore_2006,copyrights so that
4033_AlGore_2006,young people can remix it and do it in their own way
4034_AlGore_2006,where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm 's length from politics <unk> it doesn 't mean that if you 're a republican that i 'm trying to convince you to be a democrat
4035_AlGore_2006,we need republicans as well this used to be a bipartisan issue <unk> and i know that in this group it really is become politically active make our democracy work the way it 's supposed to work
4036_AlGore_2006,support the idea of capping
4037_AlGore_2006,<unk> carbon dioxide emissions
4038_AlGore_2006,global warming pollution and trading it here 's why
4039_AlGore_2006,as long as the united states is out of the world system <unk>
4040_AlGore_2006,it 's not a closed system <unk> once it becomes a closed system <unk>
4041_AlGore_2006,with u s participation then everybody who 's on a board of directors how many people here serve <unk> serve on the board of directors of a corporation
4042_AlGore_2006,once it 's a closed system <unk> you will have legal
4043_AlGore_2006,<unk> liability if you do not
4044_AlGore_2006,urge your ceo
4045_AlGore_2006,to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided
4046_AlGore_2006,the market will work to solve this problem
4047_AlGore_2006,if if we can accomplish this
4048_AlGore_2006,help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring <unk> we have to change the minds of the american people
4049_AlGore_2006,because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to to be done
4050_AlGore_2006,and in our modern country the role of logic and reason no longer no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did <unk> it 's now repetition of short
4051_AlGore_2006,<unk> as many of you have suggested <unk> i like climate crisis instead of climate collapse but again those of you who are good at branding <unk> i need your help on this
4052_AlGore_2006,somebody said the test we 're facing now a scientist told me is whether
4053_AlGore_2006,the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination
4054_AlGore_2006,laughter that 's really true
4055_AlGore_2006,<unk> i said the other night and i 'll repeat now this is not a political issue <unk> again the republicans here

4058_AlGore_2006,the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them we are
4059_AlGore_2006,<unk> one thank you very much i
4060_AlGore_2006,<unk> i have given
4061_AlGore_2006,the slide show that that i gave here two years ago about two thousand times <unk>

4063_AlGore_2006,<unk> i don 't want or need to raise the bar i 'm actually trying to lower the bar <unk> because i 've cobbled this together to try to
4064_AlGore_2006,to meet the the challenge of this session and i was reminded by karen armstrong 's fantastic presentation
4065_AlGore_2006,that
4066_AlGore_2006,<unk> really properly understood is not about belief but about behavior <unk> perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism
4067_AlGore_2006,how dare we be optimistic
4068_AlGore_2006,optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief an intellectual posture
4069_AlGore_2006,as mahatma gandhi famously said you must become the change you wish to see in the world
4070_AlGore_2006,<unk> and the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic
4071_AlGore_2006,is not going to be created by the belief alone <unk> except to the extent that the belief
4072_AlGore_2006,brings about new behavior <unk>
4073_AlGore_2008,but the word behavior is also i think sometimes misunderstood in this context <unk> i 'm a big advocate of changing the
4074_AlGore_2008,<unk> lightbulbs and
4075_AlGore_2008,buying hybrids and tipper and i put thirty three solar panels on our house and dug the geothermal wells and did all of that
4076_AlGore_2008,other stuff but as important as it is to change the lightbulbs it is more important to change the laws <unk> and when we change our
4077_AlGore_2008,<unk> in our daily lives we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part in order
4078_AlGore_2008,to be optimistic about this we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy
4079_AlGore_2008,in order to solve the climate crisis <unk> we have to solve the democracy crisis <unk>
4080_AlGore_2008,<unk> and we have one <unk> i have been trying to tell this story for a long time i was reminded of that recently by
4081_AlGore_2008,a woman who walked past the table i was sitting at just staring at me as she walked past
4082_AlGore_2008,she was in her 70s looked like she had a kind face
4083_AlGore_2008,<unk> i thought nothing of it until i saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction also just staring at me <unk>
4084_AlGore_2008,and so i said how do you do
4085_AlGore_2008,and she said you know if you dyed your hair black you would look just like al gore
4086_AlGore_2008,many years ago when i was a young congressman i spent
4087_AlGore_2008,an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control the nuclear arms race <unk> and the military historians
4088_AlGore_2008,<unk> taught me during that quest that military conflicts are typically
4089_AlGore_2008,put into three categories <unk> local battles
4090_AlGore_2008,regional or theater wars <unk> and the rare but all important global world war
4091_AlGore_2008,strategic conflicts
4092_AlGore_2008,<unk> each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources a different
4093_AlGore_2008,approach
4094_AlGore_2008,a different organizational model
4095_AlGore_2008,environmental challenges fall into the same three categories <unk> and most of what we think about are local environmental problems air pollution water pollution hazardous waste dumps <unk>
4096_AlGore_2008,but there are also regional environmental
4097_AlGore_2008,<unk> like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast and from western europe to the arctic
4098_AlGore_2008,and from the midwest out the mississippi into the dead zone of the gulf of mexico and there are lots of those <unk> but the climate crisis is the rare but all important global or strategic
4099_AlGore_2008,conflict everything is affected <unk> and we have to organize our response
4100_AlGore_2008,<unk> we need a worldwide global mobilization for renewable energy conservation <unk> efficiency and a global transition to a low carbon economy <unk> we have work to do <unk>
4101_AlGore_2008,and we can mobilize resources and political will <unk>
4102_AlGore_2008,but the political will has to be mobilized in order to mobilize the resources
4103_AlGore_2008,let me show you these slides here <unk> i thought i would start with the logo
4104_AlGore_2008,what 's missing here of course is the north polar ice cap greenland remains
4105_AlGore_2008,twenty eight years ago <unk> this is what the polar ice cap
4106_AlGore_2008,the north polar ice cap looked like at the end of the summer at the fall
4107_AlGore_2008,<unk> this last fall i went to the snow and ice data center in boulder colorado <unk> and talked to the researchers here in monterey at the naval postgraduate
4108_AlGore_2008,laboratory <unk> this is what 's happened in the last twenty eight years
4109_AlGore_2008,to put it in perspective
4110_AlGore_2008,two thousand and five was the previous record <unk> here 's what happened last fall that has really
4111_AlGore_2008,unnerved the researchers
4112_AlGore_2008,the north polar ice cap is the same size geographically doesn 't look quite the same size but it is exactly the same size
4113_AlGore_2008,as the united states minus an area roughly equal to
4114_AlGore_2008,the state of arizona <unk> the amount that disappeared in two thousand and five was equivalent to everything east of the mississippi <unk> the extra amount
4115_AlGore_2008,<unk> that disappeared last fall
4116_AlGore_2008,was equivalent to this much it comes back in the in the winter <unk> but not as permanent ice as thin ice vulnerable <unk>
4117_AlGore_2008,the amount remaining
4118_AlGore_2008,could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years that puts a lot of pressure on greenland

4127_AlGore_2008,earth 's diameter is about four hundred kilometers larger but
4128_AlGore_2008,essentially the same size they have exactly the same amount of carbon <unk> but the difference
4129_AlGore_2008,<unk> is on earth most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere <unk> deposited in the ground as
4130_AlGore_2008,coal oil natural gas etc on venus most of it is in the atmosphere <unk>
4131_AlGore_2008,the difference is that our temperature is fifty nine degrees on average
4132_AlGore_2008,<unk> this is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible and putting it into the atmosphere <unk>
4133_AlGore_2008,it 's not because venus is slightly closer to the sun it 's three times hotter than mercury which is right next to the sun <unk>
4134_AlGore_2008,now briefly here 's an image you 've seen as one of the only old images but i show it because i want to briefly give you

4389_AlGore_2016,it 's an enormous burden i 'll mention just one more because the world economic forum
4390_AlGore_2016,last month in davos after their annual survey of seven hundred and fifty economists said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy
4391_AlGore_2016,<unk> so you get central bankers like mark carney the head of the uk central bank saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are

4402_AlGore_2016,<unk> an average basis more good news energy storage from batteries particularly is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem with solar the news is even more exciting

4406_AlGore_2016,we have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves
4407_AlGore_2016,and the cost has come down ten percent per year for thirty years and it 's continuing
4408_AlGore_2016,<unk> to come down now the business community has certainly noticed this <unk> because it 's crossing the grid parity point cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise grid parity <unk>

4416_AlGore_2016,<unk> through to safer and more acceptable more affordable forms of nuclear this could change even more dramatically <unk>

4420_AlGore_2016,<unk> of the year they sold one hundred and twenty times more and now there are more cell connections than there are people in the world so
4421_AlGore_2016,<unk> and i think the answer is in three parts
4422_AlGore_2016,first the cost came down much faster than anybody expected even as the quality went up and low income countries places that did not have a landline grid <unk>
4423_AlGore_2016,they leap frogged to the new technology the big expansion has been in the developing counties so what about the electricity grids in the developing world <unk> well not so hot and in many
4424_AlGore_2016,<unk> areas they don 't exist there are more people without any electricity at all in india than the entire population of the united states of america so now we 're getting this <unk> solar panels <unk>
4425_AlGore_2016,<unk> on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable muhammad yunus financed this one in bangladesh
4426_AlGore_2016,<unk> country in the world two systems per minute on average night and day and we have all we need <unk> enough energy from the sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world 's energy <unk>
4427_AlGore_2016,<unk> needs for an entire year it 's actually a little bit less than an hour so the answer to the second question
4428_AlGore_2016,<unk> some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot but nations aren 't waiting they 're going ahead china has already announced that starting next year <unk> they 're adopting a nationwide <unk>
4429_AlGore_2016,<unk> cap and trade system they will likely link up with the european union the united states has already been changing all of these coal plants were proposed in the next ten years and canceled all of these existing coal plants were retired
4430_AlGore_2016,<unk> of these coal plants have had their retirement announced all of them
4431_AlGore_2016,canceled <unk>
4432_AlGore_2016,we are moving forward last year if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the united states <unk> almost three quarters was from renewable energy mostly wind and solar we are solving this
4433_AlGore_2016,<unk> the only question is how long will it take to get there so
4434_AlGore_2016,it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change almost four hundred thousand people marched in new york city before <unk>
4435_AlGore_2016,<unk> the un special session on this many thousands <unk> tens of thousands marched in cities around the world <unk> and so
4436_AlGore_2016,<unk> this i 'll finish with this story when i was thirteen years old
4437_AlGore_2016,i heard that proposal by president kennedy to land a person on the moon and bring him back safely in ten years
4438_AlGore_2016,and i heard adults of that day and time say that 's reckless expensive <unk> may well fail but eight years and two months later in the moment that neil armstrong set foot on the moon
4439_AlGore_2016,<unk> there was great cheer that went up in nasa 's mission control in houston <unk> here 's a little known fact about that the average age of the systems engineers the controllers in the room that day was <unk>
4440_AlGore_2016,which means among other things their age when they heard that challenge was eighteen we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced
4441_AlGore_2016,<unk> the greatest poets of the last century in the us wallace stevens <unk> wrote a line that has stayed with me after the final ' no ' there comes a ' yes ' and on that ' yes ' the future world depends

4443_AlGore_2016,<unk> against apartheid and more recently the movement for gay and lesbian rights
4444_AlGore_2016,here in the united states and elsewhere after the final no comes a yes when any great moral challenge
4445_AlGore_2016,is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong the outcome is <unk> fore ordained because of who we are as human beings
4446_AlGore_2016,<unk> that is where we are now and it is why we 're going to win this <unk> we have everything we need some still doubt that we have the will to act <unk> but i say <unk>
4447_AlGore_2016,the will to act is itself a renewable resource <unk> thank you very much
4448_AlGore_2016,<unk> you 've got this incredible combination of skills you 've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues <unk>
4449_AlGore_2016,and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language no one else can do that that 's why you led this thing <unk>
4450_AlGore_2016,it was amazing to see it ten years ago it was amazing to see it now
4451_AlGore_2016,really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until i can
4452_AlGore_2016,get can get it into simple enough language that i can understand it and that 's the key to trying to communicate
4453_AlGore_2016,<unk> know that all those graphs all that progress is enough
4454_AlGore_2016,to solve what you showed in the first part <unk> ag i think that
4455_AlGore_2016,the crossing you know i 've only been in the business world for fifteen years
4456_AlGore_2016,but one of the things i 've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent or cheaper than
4457_AlGore_2016,turns out it makes a difference if it 's cheaper than
4458_AlGore_2016,and when it it crosses that line then a lot of things really change <unk> we are regularly surprised by these developments the late rudi dornbusch the great economist said
4459_AlGore_2016,things take longer to happen then you think they will and then they happen much faster than you thought they could i really think that 's where we are some people are using the phrase
4460_AlGore_2016,<unk> when it gets below the grid parity unsubsidized in most places then it 's the default choice now
4461_AlGore_2016,in one of the presentations yesterday <unk> the jitney thing <unk> there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down <unk>
4462_AlGore_2016,and i just don 't think it 's going to work
4463_AlGore_2016,there 's a woman in atlanta debbie dooley who 's the chairman of the atlanta tea party <unk> they enlisted her
4464_AlGore_2016,<unk> in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations and she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn 't understand the request and so she went and
4465_AlGore_2016,and formed an alliance with the sierra club and they formed a new organization called the green tea party
4466_AlGore_2016,laughter and they defeated the proposal
4467_AlGore_2016,<unk> the answer to your question is this sounds a little corny and maybe it 's a clich
4468_AlGore_2016,but ten years ago and christiana referred to this there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating <unk>
4469_AlGore_2016,<unk> those exponential curves <unk> and it didn 't work out economically for some of them <unk> but it kick started this global revolution and what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we
4470_AlGore_2016,<unk> are going to win this <unk> but it matters a lot how fast we win it ca al gore <unk>
4471_AlGore_2016,that was incredibly powerful if this turns out to be the year <unk> that the partisan thing changes <unk>
4472_AlGore_2016,<unk> as you said it 's no longer a partisan issue <unk> but you bring along people from the other side together <unk> backed
4473_AlGore_2016,by science backed by these kinds of investment opportunities backed by reason that you win the day boy <unk> that 's really exciting thank you so much
4474_AlGore_2016,<unk> we 're going to talk my a new lecture just for ted and i 'm going show you some illusions that we 've created for ted
4475_AlGore_2016,and i 'm going to try to relate this to happiness what i was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness
4476_AlGore_2016,happiness which i equate with joy in my particular area
4477_AlGore_2016,<unk> there 's something very fundamental <unk> and i was thinking about this <unk> and it 's in terms of both illusions
4478_AlGore_2016,and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that
4479_AlGore_2016,there 's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way <unk> you go see a movie
4480_AlGore_2016,<unk> has an unexpected twist something that you didn 't expect and you find a joyful experience you look at those sort of illusions in my book
4481_AlGore_2016,and it 's not as what you 'd expect and there 's something joyful about it and it 's the same thing with jokes and and all these sorts of things so what i 'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit
4482_AlGore_2016,further and see if i can violate your expectations in a
4483_AlGore_2016,pleasing way i mean sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant but i 'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way in a very primal way <unk> so i can make the audience here happy <unk>
4484_AlGore_2016,so i 'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations
4485_AlGore_2016,first of all i want to show you the particular illusion here i want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other
4486_AlGore_2016,these are all perceptual tricks
4487_AlGore_2016,these are real objects that i 'm going to show you
4488_AlGore_2016,now i 'm going to show you how it is done i 've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience <unk> i want you to see
4489_AlGore_2016,how this illusion is constructed and it 's going to rotate so you see that it 's inside out now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception
4490_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> snaps
4491_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> ok now watch it as it rotates back again <unk> and this is a very bright audience all right see if you can stop it from happening <unk> even though you know one hundred percent it 's true that
4492_AlSeckel_2004,bam <unk> you can 't undo it
4493_AlSeckel_2004,what does that tell you about yourselves
4494_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> we 're going to do it again <unk> no doubt about it see if you can stop it from happening <unk> no <unk> it 's difficult <unk>
4495_AlSeckel_2004,and we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation about shape about color and <unk>
4496_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> so forth and it 's very primal and it 's an interesting question to ponder <unk> why these things
4497_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> that lionel did a while ago i like these sort of little things like this again
4498_AlSeckel_2004,this is not an optical trick this is what you would see
4499_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> not a camera cut it 's a perceptual trick <unk>
4500_AlSeckel_2004,ok we can violate your expectations about shape
4501_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> we can violate your expectations on representation
4502_AlSeckel_2004,raise your hand if you see dolphins
4503_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> ok those people who raised their hands <unk> afterwards the rest of the audience go talk to them all right
4504_AlSeckel_2004,actually this is the best example of priming by experience that i know <unk>
4505_AlSeckel_2004,if you are a child under the age of ten who haven 't been ruined yet
4506_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> you will look at this image and see dolphins <unk> now <unk> some of you adults here are saying what dolphins what dolphins but in fact
4507_AlSeckel_2004,if you reversed the figure ground in other words the dark areas here i forgot to ask for a pointer but if you reverse it you 'll see a whole series of little dolphins by the way if you 're also a student at caltech they also
4508_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design too this was done by saatchi and saatchi and they actually got away with this ad in australia so <unk>
4509_AlSeckel_2004,if you look at this ad for beer all those people are in sort of
4510_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> how you can do these things <unk> remember that sort of um
4511_AlSeckel_2004,this is the joke i did
4512_AlSeckel_2004,when
4513_AlSeckel_2004,the florida ballot was going around you know count the dots for gore count the dots for bush <unk> count ' em again <unk>
4514_AlSeckel_2004,you can violate your expectations about experience here is
4515_AlSeckel_2004,an outside water fountain
4516_AlSeckel_2004,that i created with some friends of mine but you can stop the water in drops and actually make all the drops
4517_AlSeckel_2004,this is something we 're building for you know amusement parks and that kind of stuff now let 's take a static image can you see this do you see the middle
4518_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> section moving down and the outer sections moving up it 's completely static it 's a static image how many people see this illusion
4519_AlSeckel_2004,it 's completely static right now when
4520_AlSeckel_2004,it 's interesting that when we look at an image we see you know color depth
4521_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> and you can look at this whole scene and analyze it you can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth but the whole thing is actually flat it
4522_AlSeckel_2004,'s painted it 's trompe l 'oeil
4523_AlSeckel_2004,and it was such a good trompe l 'oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman
4524_AlSeckel_2004,and she wouldn 't respond <unk>
4525_AlSeckel_2004,now <unk> you can make design
4526_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> like this building in new york so that when you
4527_AlSeckel_2004,see it from this side it looks like the balconies tilt up and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies
4528_AlSeckel_2004,go down so there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions or you take this particular
4529_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> enough i get a lot of emails from people who say is there any perceptual difference between males and females
4530_AlSeckel_2004,and i really say no i mean women can navigate through the world just as well as males can and why wouldn 't they
4531_AlSeckel_2004,however this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching which head
4532_AlSeckel_2004,because they rely on fashion cues they can match the hat
4533_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> okay now getting to a part i want to show design in illusions <unk> i believe that the first example of illusions <unk>
4534_AlSeckel_2004,being used purposely was by da vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye <unk>
4535_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings where you could flip the image and see it from one little
4536_AlSeckel_2004,point of view like this but these are early
4537_AlSeckel_2004,incorporations of illusions brought to sort of high point with hans holbein 's ambassadors and hans holbein worked for henry viii
4538_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull all
4539_AlSeckel_2004,right now i 'm going to show you some
4540_AlSeckel_2004,designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise one of my favorites is scott kim <unk>
4541_AlSeckel_2004,i worked with scott to create some illusions for ted
4542_AlSeckel_2004,that i hope you will enjoy <unk> we
4543_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> hasn 't talked yet <unk> but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his
4544_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> there 's analog and digital
4545_AlSeckel_2004,and figure goes to ground
4546_AlSeckel_2004,and for the musicians
4547_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> and of course since happiness we want joy to the world
4548_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> another great designer he 's very well known in japan
4549_AlSeckel_2004,shigeo fukuda <unk> and he just builds some fantastic things <unk> this is simply amazing <unk>
4550_AlSeckel_2004,this is a pile of junk
4551_AlSeckel_2004,that when you view it from one particular angle
4552_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano
4553_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> transforms to violinist <unk>
4554_AlSeckel_2004,this is really wild <unk>
4555_AlSeckel_2004,this assemblage of forks knives and spoons and various cutlery <unk> welded together
4556_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> a shadow of a motorcycle <unk>
4557_AlSeckel_2004,you learn something in the sort of thing that i do <unk>
4558_AlSeckel_2004,which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands <unk>
4559_AlSeckel_2004,ken knowlton does wonderful composite images
4560_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> but just by rearranging them he did einstein out of dice
4561_AlSeckel_2004,because after all <unk> einstein said god does not play dice with the universe bert herzog out of
4562_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education by comparison
4563_AlSeckel_2004,if you talk to someone today in
4564_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> about sexual activity
4565_AlSeckel_2004,you 'll find pretty soon you 're not just talking about sexual activity you 're also talking about baseball
4566_AlSeckel_2004,because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity
4567_AlSeckel_2004,and we know that because there 's all this language in english that seems to be talking about baseball but that 's really talking about
4568_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> sexual activity so for example
4569_AlSeckel_2004,you can be a pitcher or a catcher and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act of
4570_AlSeckel_2004,course there are the bases which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order
4571_AlSeckel_2004,ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of
4572_AlSeckel_2004,<unk> orgasm at least for the guy laughter
4573_AlSeckel_2004,you can strike out which means you don 't get to have any sexual activity
4574_AlSeckel_2004,and if you 're a benchwarmer you might be a virgin or somebody who for whatever reason isn 't in the game maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skillset
4575_AlSeckel_2004,a bat 's a penis and a nappy dugout is a vulva or a
4576_AlSeckel_2004,a glove or a catcher 's mitt is a condom
4577_AlSeckel_2004,a switch hitter is a bisexual person and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team
4578_AlSeckel_2004,and then there 's this one if there 's grass on the field play ball
4579_AlSeckel_2004,and that usually refers to if a young person specifically often a young woman is old enough to have
4580_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> pubic hair she 's old enough to have sex with
4581_AlVernacchio_2012,this baseball model is incredibly problematic it 's sexist it 's heterosexist it 's competitive it 's goal directed and it can 't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults
4582_AlVernacchio_2012,so we need a new model
4583_AlVernacchio_2012,i 'm here today to offer you that new model
4584_AlVernacchio_2012,and it 's based on
4585_AlVernacchio_2012,pizza
4586_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience so let 's do this let 's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity
4587_AlVernacchio_2012,the trigger for sexual activity what happens during sexual activity and the expected outcome of sexual activity
4588_AlVernacchio_2012,so when do you play baseball you play baseball when it 's
4589_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> season and when there 's a game on the schedule it 's not exactly your choice
4590_AlVernacchio_2012,so if it 's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents aren 't home hey it 's just batter up
4591_AlVernacchio_2012,can you imagine saying to your coach uh i 'm
4592_AlVernacchio_2012,not really feeling it today i think i 'll sit this game out that 's just not the way it happens and when you get together to play baseball immediately you
4593_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> with two opposing teams one playing offense one playing defense somebody 's trying to move deeper into the field that 's usually a sign to the boy somebody 's trying to defend people moving into the field that 's often given to the girl
4594_AlVernacchio_2012,it 's competitive we 're not playing with each other we 're playing against each other and when you show up to play baseball nobody needs to talk about what we 're going to do or how this baseball game might be good
4595_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> for us everybody knows the rules you just take your position and play the game
4596_AlVernacchio_2012,but when do you have pizza
4597_AlVernacchio_2012,well you have pizza
4598_AlVernacchio_2012,when you 're hungry for pizza it starts with an internal sense an internal desire or a need huh
4599_AlVernacchio_2012,i could go for some pizza
4600_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> and because it 's an internal desire we actually have some sense of control over that i could decide that i 'm hungry but know that it 's not a great time to eat
4601_AlVernacchio_2012,and then when we get together with someone for pizza we 're not competing with them
4602_AlVernacchio_2012,we 're looking for an experience that both of us will share that that 's satisfying for both of us and when you get together for pizza with somebody what 's the first thing you do you talk about it
4603_AlVernacchio_2012,you talk about what you want you talk about what you like you may even negotiate it how do you feel about pepperoni laughter
4604_AlVernacchio_2012,not so much i 'm kind of a mushroom guy myself well maybe we can go half and half
4605_AlVernacchio_2012,and even if you 've had pizza with somebody for a very long time
4606_AlVernacchio_2012,don 't you still say things like should we get the usual laughter or maybe something a little more adventurous
4607_AlVernacchio_2012,okay so when you 're playing baseball so if we talk about during sexual activity when you 're playing baseball you 're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order one at a time you can 't hit the ball and run to right field
4608_AlVernacchio_2012,that doesn 't work and you also can 't get to second base and say i like it here i 'm going to stay here
4609_AlVernacchio_2012,no and also of course with baseball there
4610_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> 's like the specific equipment and a specific skill set not everybody can play baseball it 's pretty exclusive
4611_AlVernacchio_2012,okay but what about pizza when we 're trying to figure out what 's good for pizza isn 't it all about
4612_AlVernacchio_2012,what 's our pleasure there are a million different kinds of pizza there 's a million different toppings there 's a million different ways to eat pizza and none of them are wrong they 're different
4613_AlVernacchio_2012,and in this case difference is good
4614_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> because that 's going to increase the chance that we 're having a satisfying experience
4615_AlVernacchio_2012,and lastly what 's the expected outcome of baseball well in baseball you play to win
4616_AlVernacchio_2012,you score as many runs as you can there 's always a winner in baseball and that means there 's always a loser in baseball
4617_AlVernacchio_2012,but what about pizza well in pizza we 're not really there 's no winning how do you
4618_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> win pizza
4619_AlVernacchio_2012,you don 't
4620_AlVernacchio_2012,but you do look for are we satisfied
4621_AlVernacchio_2012,and sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or on different days
4622_AlVernacchio_2012,and we get to decide when we feel satisfied if we 're still hungry we might have some more if you eat too much though you just feel gross
4623_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education
4624_AlVernacchio_2012,a lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model and it sets up education that can 't help
4625_AlVernacchio_2012,but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people
4626_AlVernacchio_2012,and those young people become older people but if we could create sexuality education
4627_AlVernacchio_2012,<unk> that was more like pizza
4628_AlVernacchio_2012,we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires to make deliberate decisions about what they want
4629_AlVernacchio_2012,to talk about it with their partners and to ultimately look for not some external outcome

4693_AlaaMurabit_2015W,and until we can change the system entirely <unk>
4694_AlaaMurabit_2015W,then we can 't realistically expect to have full economic and political participation of women
4695_AlaaMurabit_2015W,our foundation is broken
4696_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> my mom actually says you can 't build a straight house on a crooked foundation

4701_AlaaMurabit_2015W,a medium <unk> we were part of decision making we were information sharing we were crucial <unk>
4702_AlaaMurabit_2015W,and i wanted and needed for that change to be permanent <unk>
4703_AlaaMurabit_2015W,turns out that 's not that easy it only took a few weeks before the women that i had
4704_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> previously worked with were returning back to their previous roles and most of them were driven by words of encouragement
4705_AlaaMurabit_2015W,from religious and political leaders most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense
4706_AlaaMurabit_2015W,it 's how they gained popular support for their opinions
4707_AlaaMurabit_2015W,so initially i focused on the economic and political empowerment of women i thought that
4708_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> lead to cultural and social change it turns out it does a little <unk> but not a lot
4709_AlaaMurabit_2015W,i decided to use their defense as my offense <unk> and i began to cite and highlight islamic scripture as well

4716_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> verses from the quran and sayings of the prophet hadiths his sayings which

4719_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> violence policies were changed
4720_AlaaMurabit_2015W,in certain communities we actually had to go as far
4721_AlaaMurabit_2015W,as saying the international human rights declaration which you opposed because it wasn 't written by religious scholars <unk>
4722_AlaaMurabit_2015W,well <unk> those same principles are are in our book <unk>
4723_AlaaMurabit_2015W,so really the united nations just copied us
4724_AlaaMurabit_2015W,by changing the message <unk> we were able to provide an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in libya <unk>
4725_AlaaMurabit_2015W,it 's something that has now been replicated internationally <unk>
4726_AlaaMurabit_2015W,and while i am not saying it 's easy believe me <unk> it 's not liberals

4732_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> be at the table <unk>
4733_AlaaMurabit_2015W,we have to stop giving up our position because by remaining silent we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide

4739_AlaaMurabit_2015W,not for us
4740_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> for the women in your families not for the women in this room not even for the women out there <unk> but for societies that would be transformed
4741_AlaaMurabit_2015W,with the participation of women
4742_AlaaMurabit_2015W,and the only way we can do that our only option is to be and remain at the table <unk> thank you
4743_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> sunday evening just as the sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that i normally end up
4744_AlaaMurabit_2015W,weeping into a pillow <unk> i 'm mentioning all
4745_AlaaMurabit_2015W,i 'm mentioning all this because i think this is not merely a personal problem you may think i 'm wrong in this <unk> but i think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises <unk>
4746_AlaaMurabit_2015W,by moments when what we thought we knew about our lives about our careers comes into contact with
4747_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> free of career anxiety i want to look
4748_AlaaMurabit_2015W,now if i may at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers why we might be victims of these career crises as we 're weeping softly into our pillows
4749_AlaaMurabit_2015W,one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by
4750_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> 've got some bad news particularly to anybody who 's come to oxford from abroad there 's a real problem with snobbery because sometimes people from outside the u k imagine that snobbery is a distinctively u k phenomenon <unk>
4751_AlaaMurabit_2015W,fixated on country houses and titles the bad news is that 's not true snobbery is a global phenomenon <unk> we are a global organization this is a global phenomenon what is a snob a snob is anybody who takes a small part of you
4752_AlaaMurabit_2015W,snobbery <unk> the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery you encounter it within minutes at a party when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early <unk>
4753_AlaaMurabit_2015W,what do you do
4754_AlaaMurabit_2015W,according to how you answer that question people are either incredibly delighted to see you or look at their watch and make their excuses now the opposite of a snob is your mother
4755_AlaaMurabit_2015W,necessarily your mother <unk> or indeed mine but as it were the ideal mother <unk> somebody who doesn 't care about your achievements unfortunately most people are not our mothers <unk> most people make a strict correlation <unk>
4756_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> between how much time and if you like love not romantic love though that may be something but love in general respect they are willing to accord us <unk> that will be strictly
4757_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> our position in the social hierarchy <unk> and that 's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods you know
4758_AlaaMurabit_2015W,we 're often told that we live in very materialistic times that we 're all greedy people i don 't think we are particularly materialistic i think we live in a society which has simply pegged <unk>
4759_AlaaMurabit_2015W,certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods <unk> it 's not the material goods we want it 's the rewards we want it 's a new way of looking at luxury goods the next time you see somebody
4760_AlaaMurabit_2015W,<unk> driving a ferrari don 't think this is somebody who 's greedy think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love
4761_AlaaMurabit_2015W,laughter feel sympathy <unk> rather than contempt <unk> there are other reasons
4762_AlaaMurabit_2015W,there are other reasons why it 's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before one
4763_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> and it 's paradoxical because it 's linked to something that 's rather nice is the hope we all have for our careers <unk> never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan we 're told
4764_AlaindeBotton_2009G,from many sources that anyone can achieve anything <unk> we 've done away with the caste system <unk> we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position
4765_AlaindeBotton_2009G,they please and it 's a beautiful
4766_AlaindeBotton_2009G,idea <unk> along with that is a kind of spirit of equality we 're all
4767_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> is one really big problem with this <unk> and that problem is envy
4768_AlaindeBotton_2009G,envy it 's a real taboo to mention envy but if there 's one dominant emotion in modern society that is envy <unk> and it 's linked to the spirit of equality <unk> let me explain i think it would be very unusual for anyone here or anyone watching
4769_AlaindeBotton_2009G,to be envious of the queen of england even though
4770_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> the reason why we don 't envy her is because she 's too weird she 's simply too strange
4771_AlaindeBotton_2009G,we can 't relate to her she speaks in a funny way she comes from an odd place so we can 't relate to her <unk> and when you can 't relate to somebody you don 't envy them the closer two people are
4772_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> in age in background in the process of identification the more there 's a danger of envy which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion because there is no
4773_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> stronger reference point than people one one was at school with the problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school everybody 's wearing jeans everybody 's the same and yet they 're not so <unk>
4774_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> there 's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality <unk> which can make for a very stressful situation it 's probably as unlikely
4775_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would accede to the ranks of the french aristocracy but the point is it doesn 't feel that way <unk> it 's made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if you 've got energy a few bright ideas about technology a garage
4776_AlaindeBotton_2009G,you too could start a major
4777_AlaindeBotton_2009G,thing laughter
4778_AlaindeBotton_2009G,the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops when you go to a large bookshop and look at the self help sections as i sometimes do if you analyze self help books produced in the world today there are basically two kinds
4779_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> kinds the first kind tells you you can do it you can make it anything 's possible the other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call low <unk>
4780_AlaindeBotton_2009G,or impolitely call feeling very bad about yourself there 's <unk>
4781_AlaindeBotton_2009G,a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything and the existence of low <unk> self esteem so that 's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback there is another reason why we
4782_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> might be feeling more anxious about our careers about our status in the world today than ever before <unk> and it 's again linked to something nice <unk> and that nice thing is called meritocracy
4783_AlaindeBotton_2009G,everybody all politicians on left and right agree that meritocracy is a great thing <unk> and we should all be trying to make our societies really really meritocratic
4784_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> other words what is a meritocratic society a meritocratic society is one in which if you 've got talent and energy and skill <unk> you will get to the top <unk> nothing should hold you back it 's a beautiful idea <unk> the problem is <unk>
4785_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top get to the top you 'll also by implication and in a far more nasty way believe in a society where those who <unk>
4786_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there <unk> in other words your position in life comes to seem not accidental but merited and deserved
4787_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> and that makes failure seem much more crushing you know in the middle ages <unk>
4788_AlaindeBotton_2009G,in england when you met a very poor person
4789_AlaindeBotton_2009G,that person would be described as an unfortunate literally somebody who had not been blessed by fortune an unfortunate nowadays
4790_AlaindeBotton_2009G,particularly in the united states if you meet someone at the bottom of society they may unkindly be described as a
4791_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> there 's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser and that shows four hundred years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives it 's no longer the gods <unk>
4792_AlaindeBotton_2009G,it 's us <unk> we 're in the driving seat that 's exhilarating if you 're doing well and very crushing if you 're not it leads in the worst cases in the analysis of a sociologist like emil durkheim it leads to increased rates of suicide <unk>
4793_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally they own their success but they also own
4794_AlaindeBotton_2009G,their failure
4795_AlaindeBotton_2009G,is there any relief from some of these pressures that i 've been outlining i think there is <unk> i just want to turn to a few of them <unk> let 's take meritocracy
4796_AlaindeBotton_2009G,this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to
4797_AlaindeBotton_2009G,i think it 's a crazy idea completely crazy i will support any politician of left and right with any
4798_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> idea <unk> i am a meritocrat in that sense <unk> but i think it 's insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic it 's an impossible dream the idea that we will make a society where literally <unk>
4799_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> everybody is graded the good at the top <unk> bad at the bottom exactly done as it should be is impossible there are simply too many random factors <unk> accidents accidents of birth
4800_AlaindeBotton_2009G,things dropping on people 's heads illnesses etc we will never get to grade them
4801_AlaindeBotton_2009G,never get to grade people as they should i 'm drawn to a lovely quote by st augustine in the city of god where he says it 's a sin to judge any man by his post
4802_AlaindeBotton_2009G,in modern english that would mean it 's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to dependent on their business card <unk> it 's not the post that should count
4803_AlaindeBotton_2009G,according to st augustine only god can
4804_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> really put everybody in their place he 's going to do that on the day of judgment with angels and trumpets and the skies will open insane idea if you 're a secularist person like me <unk> but something very valuable in that idea <unk>
4805_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> nevertheless <unk> in other words <unk> hold your horses when you 're coming to judge people you don 't necessarily know
4806_AlaindeBotton_2009G,a loss of income a loss of status what we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others <unk> and it exists <unk> the number one organ of ridicule <unk> nowadays is the newspaper <unk>
4807_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> if you open the newspaper any day of the week it 's full of people who 've messed up their lives they 've slept with the wrong person taken the wrong substance passed the wrong piece of legislation whatever it is and then are fit for for ridicule <unk> in other words they have failed <unk> and they are described as
4808_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> now is there any alternative to this i think the western tradition shows us one glorious alternative which is tragedy
4809_AlaindeBotton_2009G,tragic art <unk> as it developed in the theaters of ancient greece in the fifth century b c was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail
4810_AlaindeBotton_2009G,and
4811_AlaindeBotton_2009G,also according them a level of sympathy <unk> which ordinary
4812_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> would not necessarily
4813_AlaindeBotton_2009G,accord them a few years ago i was thinking about this and i went to the sunday sport a tabloid newspaper i don 't recommend you start reading if you 're not familiar with it already
4814_AlaindeBotton_2009G,i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art <unk> i wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item
4815_AlaindeBotton_2009G,at the news desk on a saturday afternoon i mentioned othello they 'd not heard of it but were fascinated
4816_AlaindeBotton_2009G,immigrant kills senator 's daughter splashed across the headline i gave them the plotline of madame bovary again a book they were enchanted to discover <unk> and they wrote
4817_AlaindeBotton_2009G,shopaholic adulteress swallows arsenic after credit fraud and then my favorite
4818_AlaindeBotton_2009G,they really do have a kind of genius of their own these guys my favorite is sophocles
4819_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> in a way if you like at one end of the spectrum of sympathy <unk>
4820_AlaindeBotton_2009G,you 've got the tabloid newspaper at the other end of the spectrum you 've got tragedy and tragic art <unk> and i suppose i 'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what 's happening in tragic art <unk> it would be insane to call hamlet a loser <unk> he is not a
4821_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> though he has lost and i think that is the message of tragedy to us and why it 's so very very
4822_AlaindeBotton_2009G,important i think the other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is non human we are the first society
4823_AlaindeBotton_2009G,to be living in a world where we don 't worship anything other than ourselves we think very highly of ourselves and so we should we 've put people on the moon done all sorts of extraordinary things
4824_AlaindeBotton_2009G,and so we tend to worship ourselves our heroes are human heroes <unk> that 's a very new situation
4825_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> most other societies have had right at their center the worship of something transcendent <unk> a god a spirit a natural force the universe whatever it is something else that is being worshiped <unk>
4826_AlaindeBotton_2009G,we 've slightly lost the habit of doing that which is i think why we 're particularly drawn to nature
4827_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> not for the sake of our health though it 's often presented that way <unk> but because it 's an escape from the human anthill
4828_AlaindeBotton_2009G,it 's an escape from our own competition and our own dramas
4829_AlaindeBotton_2009G,and that 's why we enjoy looking at
4830_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> glaciers and oceans and contemplating the earth from outside its perimeters <unk> etc <unk> we like to feel
4831_AlaindeBotton_2009G,in contact with something that is non human and that is so deeply
4832_AlaindeBotton_2009G,important to us what i think i 've been talking about really is success and failure <unk> and one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it
4833_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> if i said that there 's somebody behind the screen who 's very very successful certain ideas would immediately come to mind you 'd think that person might have made a lot of money
4834_AlaindeBotton_2009G,achieved renown in some field
4835_AlaindeBotton_2009G,my own theory of success i 'm somebody who 's very interested in success i really want to be successful always thinking how can i be more successful <unk> but as i get older i 'm also very nuanced about what that word success might mean
4836_AlaindeBotton_2009G,here 's an insight that i 've had about success you can 't be successful at everything
4837_AlaindeBotton_2009G,we hear a lot of talk about
4838_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> you can 't have it all you can 't so any vision of success has to admit what it 's losing out on where the element of loss is <unk>
4839_AlaindeBotton_2009G,and i think any wise life will accept as i say
4840_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> that there is going to be an element where we 're not succeeding <unk> and the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully
4841_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> sucked in from other people chiefly if you 're a man your father and if you 're a woman your mother <unk>
4842_AlaindeBotton_2009G,psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about eighty years no one 's quite listening hard enough but i very much believe it 's true
4843_AlaindeBotton_2009G,and we also suck in messages from everything from the television
4844_AlaindeBotton_2009G,to advertising to marketing <unk> etc <unk> these are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves
4845_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> when we 're told that banking is a very respectable profession a lot of us want to go into banking when banking is no longer so respectable we lose interest in banking <unk> we are highly open
4846_AlaindeBotton_2009G,to suggestion
4847_AlaindeBotton_2009G,so what i want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success <unk> but we should make sure that they are our own we should focus in on our ideas and
4848_AlaindeBotton_2009G,make sure that we own them that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions because it 's bad enough not getting what you want <unk> but it 's even worse to have an idea
4849_AlaindeBotton_2009G,of what it is you want and find out at the end of the journey that it isn 't in fact what you wanted all along so i 'm going to end it there but
4850_AlaindeBotton_2009G,what i really want to
4851_AlaindeBotton_2009G,to stress is by all means success <unk> yes <unk> but let 's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas let 's probe away at our notions of success let 's make sure our ideas of
4852_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> that was fascinating but how do you reconcile this idea of it being bad to think of someone as a
4853_AlaindeBotton_2009G,the idea that a lot of people like of
4854_AlaindeBotton_2009G,seizing control of your life
4855_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> and that a society that encourages that perhaps has to have some winners and losers alain de botton
4856_AlaindeBotton_2009G,yes i think it 's merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that i want to stress because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything and politicians always talk about justice now i 'm a firm believer in justice <unk> i just think that it 's impossible
4857_AlaindeBotton_2009G,we should do everything we can to pursue it but we should always remember that whoever is facing us
4858_AlaindeBotton_2009G,whatever has happened in their lives there will be a strong element of the haphazard <unk> that 's what i 'm trying to leave room for otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic ca
4859_AlaindeBotton_2009G,i mean do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy
4860_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> or do you think that you can 't
4861_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> but it doesn 't matter that much that we 're putting too much emphasis on that ab the nightmare thought
4862_AlaindeBotton_2009G,is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them
4863_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge
4864_AlaindeBotton_2009G,you want to think who would you like as your ideal dad and your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle and it 's a very hard line to make we need fathers as it were the
4865_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> father figures in society <unk> avoiding the two extremes which is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand and on the other the lax
4866_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don
4867_AlaindeBotton_2009G,'t into the religious and the atheists <unk> and for the last decade or so
4868_AlaindeBotton_2009G,it 's been quite clear what being an atheist means there have been some very vocal
4869_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> vocal atheists who 've pointed out not just that religion is wrong <unk> but that it 's ridiculous
4870_AlaindeBotton_2009G,these people many of whom have lived in north oxford have
4871_AlaindeBotton_2009G,argued they 've argued that believing in god is akin to believing in fairies
4872_AlaindeBotton_2009G,and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game <unk> now
4873_AlaindeBotton_2009G,i think it 's too easy i think it 's too easy
4874_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> to dismiss the whole of religion that way <unk>
4875_AlaindeBotton_2009G,and it 's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel and what i 'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist if you like a new version of atheism we could call atheism two point zero <unk>
4876_AlaindeBotton_2009G,now what is atheism two point zero well it starts from a very basic premise
4877_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> there 's no god of course there are no deities or supernatural
4878_AlaindeBotton_2009G,spirits or angels <unk> etc <unk> now let 's move on that 's not the end of the story that 's the very very beginning
4879_AlaindeBotton_2009G,i 'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines that thinks i can 't believe in any of this stuff i can 't believe in the doctrines i don 't think these doctrines are right
4880_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> i love christmas carols <unk> i really like
4881_AlaindeBotton_2009G,the art of mantegna <unk> i really like looking at old churches i really like turning
4882_AlaindeBotton_2009G,the pages of the old testament whatever it may be you know the kind of thing i 'm talking about people who are attracted to the ritualistic side the moralistic communal <unk>
4883_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> side of religion but can 't bear the doctrine until now these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice it 's almost as though either you accept the doctrine
4884_AlaindeBotton_2009G,<unk> then you can have all the nice stuff or you reject the doctrine and you 're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart
4885_AlaindeBotton_2009G,so that 's a sort of tough choice <unk> i don 't think we have to make that choice <unk> i think there is an alternative i think there are ways and i 'm being both very respectful and completely impious of stealing from religions
4886_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> if you don 't believe in a religion there 's nothing wrong with picking and mixing with taking out the best sides of religion
4887_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and for me atheism two point zero is about both as i say a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying what here could we use the secular world is full of holes we have secularized badly <unk> i would argue <unk>
4888_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well
4889_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> 'd like to run through a few of these today
4890_AlaindeBotton_2011G,i 'd like to kick off by looking at education now education is a field the secular world really believes in
4891_AlaindeBotton_2011G,when we think about how we 're going to make the world a better place we think education that 's where we put a lot of money education is going to give us not only commercial skills <unk> industrial skills <unk> it 's also going to make us better
4892_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> you know the kind of thing a commencement address is and graduation ceremonies those lyrical claims
4893_AlaindeBotton_2011G,that education the process of education particularly higher education will make us into nobler and better human beings that 's a lovely idea <unk>
4894_AlaindeBotton_2011G,interesting where it came from <unk>
4895_AlaindeBotton_2011G,in the early 19th century church attendance in western europe started sliding down very very sharply and people panicked they asked themselves the following question they said
4896_AlaindeBotton_2011G,where are people going to find the morality where are they going to find guidance and where are they
4897_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> to find sources of consolation
4898_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and influential voices came up with one answer they said culture <unk>
4899_AlaindeBotton_2011G,it 's to culture that we should look for guidance for consolation for morality let 's look to the plays of shakespeare <unk> the dialogues of plato the novels of jane austen <unk> in there we 'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the gospel of saint john
4900_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> now i think that 's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea <unk> they wanted to replace scripture with culture <unk> and that 's a very plausible idea <unk> it 's also an idea that we have forgotten
4901_AlaindeBotton_2011G,if you went to a top university let 's say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge and you said i 've come here because i 'm in search of morality guidance and consolation i want to know how to live
4902_AlaindeBotton_2011G,they would show you the way to the insane asylum
4903_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> this is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of why they don 't think we need it <unk>
4904_AlaindeBotton_2011G,they don 't think we are in an urgent need of assistance <unk> they see us as adults rational adults <unk> what we need is information <unk> we need data <unk> we don 't need help <unk> now religions start <unk>
4905_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> from a very different place indeed all religions all major religions at various points call us children
4906_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> they believe that we are in severe need of assistance we 're only just holding it together <unk> perhaps this is just me <unk> maybe you
4907_AlaindeBotton_2011G,but anyway <unk> we 're only just holding it together and we need help of course we need help <unk> and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning you know
4908_AlaindeBotton_2011G,in the 18th century in the u k the greatest preacher <unk> greatest religious preacher was a man called john wesley who went up and down this country delivering sermons <unk> advising people how they could live
4909_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> he delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons <unk>
4910_AlaindeBotton_2011G,the classic medium of delivery of religions <unk> now we 've given up with the idea of sermons if you said to a modern liberal individualist hey
4911_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> wants to change your life
4912_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information <unk>
4913_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition <unk> the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable because we are in need of guidance morality
4914_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and consolation and religions know that another point about education <unk>
4915_AlaindeBotton_2011G,we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once they 'll remember it sit them in a classroom tell them about plato at the age of twenty
4916_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> them out for a career in management consultancy for forty years <unk> and that lesson will stick with them religions go nonsense <unk> you need to keep repeating the lesson ten times a day <unk> so get on your <unk>
4917_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> knees and repeat it that 's what all religions tell us get on you knees and repeat it ten or twenty or fifteen times a day otherwise our minds are like sieves <unk>
4918_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> us the new we 're always saying the new is better than the old if i said to you okay we 're not going to have new ted we 're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they 're so true we 're going to watch elizabeth gilbert five times
4919_AlaindeBotton_2011G,because what she says is so clever you 'd feel cheated not so if you 're adopting a religious mindset <unk> the other things that religions do is to arrange time
4920_AlaindeBotton_2011G,all the major religions give us calendars <unk> what is a calendar
4921_AlaindeBotton_2011G,a calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas in the catholic
4922_AlaindeBotton_2011G,chronology catholic calendar
4923_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> at the end of march you will think about st jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor you won 't do that by accident you will do that because you are guided to do that now we don 't think that way in the secular world we think if an idea is important i 'll bump into it i 'll just come across it
4924_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> says the religious
4925_AlaindeBotton_2011G,world view religious view says we need calendars we need to structure time we need to synchronize encounters
4926_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings <unk> take the moon
4927_AlaindeBotton_2011G,it 's really important to look at the moon you know when you look at the moon <unk> you think i 'm really small what are my problems it sets things into perspective
4928_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> we should all look at the moon a bit more often <unk> we don 't <unk> why don 't we well there 's nothing to tell us look at the moon
4929_AlaindeBotton_2011G,but if you 're a zen buddhist in the middle of september you will be ordered out of your home <unk> made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi where you will be given poems to read in honor <unk>
4930_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of you 'll be handed rice cakes and the moon and the reflection on the moon will have a
4931_AlaindeBotton_2011G,secure place in your heart
4932_AlaindeBotton_2011G,that 's very good <unk> the other thing that religions are really aware of is speak well i 'm not doing a very good job of this here but oratory oratory is absolutely key to religions <unk>
4933_AlaindeBotton_2011G,in the secular world you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career <unk>
4934_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> pentecostalist church in the american south and you listen to how they talk my goodness they talk well <unk> after every convincing point people will go amen amen amen at the end of a really rousing paragraph <unk>
4935_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> they 'll all stand up and they 'll go thank you jesus thank you christ thank you savior if we were doing it like they do it
4936_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> the other thing that religions know is we 're not just brains we are also bodies and when they teach us a lesson they do it via the body <unk> so
4937_AlaindeBotton_2011G,for example take the jewish idea of forgiveness jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh <unk> they don 't just deliver us sermons on this they don 't just give us books or words about
4938_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> tell us to have a bath <unk> so in orthodox jewish communities every friday you go to a mikveh <unk> you immerse yourself in the water
4939_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea <unk> we don 't tend to do that our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two let 's look at art now
4940_AlaindeBotton_2011G,now art is something that in the secular world we think very highly of we think art is really really important
4941_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums etc <unk> we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals or our new churches you 've heard that saying
4942_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> now i think that the potential is there <unk> but we 've completely let ourselves down and the reason we 've let ourselves down
4943_AlaindeBotton_2011G,is that we 're not properly studying how religions handle
4944_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> the two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art the first idea is that art should be for art 's sake a ridiculous <unk>
4945_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> idea an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world i couldn 't disagree more
4946_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> if they said it it might destroy the spell and
4947_AlaindeBotton_2011G,we might find it too easy that 's why a very common feeling when you 're in a museum let 's admit it is i don 't know what this is about
4948_AlaindeBotton_2011G,but if we 're serious people we don 't admit to that but that feeling of puzzlement is structural
4949_AlaindeBotton_2011G,to contemporary art now religions have a much saner attitude to art they have no trouble telling us what art is about art is about two things in all the major faiths <unk> firstly <unk>
4950_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> it 's trying to remind you of what there is to love and secondly <unk> it 's trying to remind you of what there is to
4951_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> fear and to hate <unk> and that 's what art is art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith <unk> so as you walk around a church or a mosque or a cathedral <unk>
4952_AlaindeBotton_2011G,what you 're trying to imbibe what you 're imbibing is through your eyes through your senses truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind <unk> essentially it 's propaganda <unk> rembrandt is a propagandist
4953_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> in the christian view now the word propaganda sets off alarm bells we think of hitler we think of stalin don 't necessarily propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something and if that thing is good there 's no problem with <unk>
4954_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> it at all my view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum if i was a museum curator i would make a room for love a <unk>
4955_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> room for generosity all works of art are talking to us about things and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where
4956_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> be told use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind <unk> we would get a lot more out of art art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we 've neglected because of certain <unk>
4957_AlaindeBotton_2011G,mis founded ideas art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society art should be didactic
4958_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> the people in the modern world in the secular world who are interested in matters of the spirit in matters of the mind in higher
4959_AlaindeBotton_2011G,soul like concerns tend to be isolated individuals <unk> they 're poets they 're philosophers they 're photographers they 're filmmakers and they tend to be on their own <unk> they 're our cottage industries <unk> they are vulnerable single people
4960_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and they get depressed and they get sad on their own
4961_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and they don 't really change much now think about religions think about organized religions what do organized religions do <unk> they group together <unk> they form institutions
4962_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and that has all sorts of advantages first of
4963_AlaindeBotton_2011G,all scale might the catholic church pulled in <unk> ninety seven billion dollars last year according to the wall street journal these are massive machines <unk> they 're collaborative <unk>
4964_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> they 're branded they 're multinational <unk> and they 're highly disciplined these are all very good qualities <unk> we recognize them in
4965_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> relation to corporations
4966_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and corporations are very like religions in many ways except they 're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs they 're selling us shoes and cars whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff the therapists the poets are on their own and they have no power <unk> they have no might
4967_AlaindeBotton_2011G,religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind <unk> now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us but we can admire the institutional way in which they 're doing it
4968_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> books written by lone individuals are not going to change anything we need to group together <unk> if you want to change the world you have to group together you have to be collaborative <unk> and that 's what
4969_AlaindeBotton_2011G,religions do they are multinational as i say <unk> they are branded they have a clear identity <unk> so they don 't get lost in a busy world
4970_AlaindeBotton_2011G,that 's something we can learn from
4971_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> i want to conclude really what i want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields there is something to learn from the example of religion even if you don 't believe any of it <unk>
4972_AlaindeBotton_2011G,if you 're involved in anything that 's communal that involves lots of people getting together <unk> there are things for you in religion if you 're involved say in a travel industry in any way look at pilgrimage look very closely
4973_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> we haven 't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven 't looked at what religions do with travel <unk> if you 're in the art world look at the example of what religions are doing with art
4974_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> and if you 're an educator in any way again look at how religions are spreading ideas <unk> you may not agree with the ideas but my goodness they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so
4975_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> intelligent in many ways that they 're not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone <unk> they 're for all of us <unk> thank you very much
4976_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters ab you can get shot by both sides you can get shot by the hard headed atheists and you can get shot by those who
4977_AlaindeBotton_2011G,fully believe ca incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment ab indeed
4978_AlaindeBotton_2011G,ca but you left out one
4979_AlaindeBotton_2011G,one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from which is this this sense that 's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who 's religious of
4980_AlaindeBotton_2011G,spiritual experience of some kind of connection with something that 's bigger than you are is there any room for that experience in atheism two point <unk>
4981_AlaindeBotton_2011G,i like many of you meet people who say things like but isn 't there something bigger than us something
4982_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> does that sense of mystery that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling
4983_AlaindeBotton_2011G,science and just observation gives us that feeling without it so i don 't feel the need
4984_AlaindeBotton_2011G,the universe is large and we are tiny without the need for further
4985_AlaindeBotton_2011G,religious superstructure <unk> so one can have so called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit
4986_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> ask a question <unk> how many people here would say that religion is important to
4987_AlaindeBotton_2011G,them is there an an equivalent process by which there 's a sort of bridge between what you 're talking about and what you would you would say to them ab i would say that there are many many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged <unk> it 's not as though
4988_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> as i try to suggest it 's not as though either you have religion
4989_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and then you have to accept all sorts of things or you don 't have religion and then you 're cut off from all these very good things <unk>
4990_AlaindeBotton_2011G,it 's so sad that we constantly say
4991_AlaindeBotton_2011G,i don 't believe so i can 't have community so i 'm cut off from morality <unk> so i can 't go on a pilgrimage one wants to say nonsense why not
4992_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and that 's really the spirit of my talk there 's so much we can absorb <unk> atheism shouldn 't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion
4993_AlaindeBotton_2011G,ca it seems to me that there 's plenty of people in the
4994_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> community who are atheists
4995_AlaindeBotton_2011G,but probably most people in the community certainly don 't think that religion is going away any time soon
4996_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common are we
4997_AlaindeBotton_2011G,foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide
4998_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> and war that there could be bridging ab no we need to be polite about differences politeness is a
4999_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> much overlooked virtue it 's seen as hypocrisy <unk> but we need to get to a stage when you 're an atheist and someone says
5000_AlaindeBotton_2011G,well you know i did pray the other day you politely ignore it <unk> you move on
5001_AlaindeBotton_2011G,because you 've agreed on ninety percent of things because you have a shared view on so many things and you politely differ
5002_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and i think that 's what the religious wars of of late have ignored they 've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement ca
5003_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and finally <unk> does this new thing that you 're proposing that 's not a religion but something else <unk> does it need a leader and are you volunteering to be the pope <unk>
5004_AlaindeBotton_2011G,one thing that we 're all very suspicious of is individual leaders <unk> it doesn 't need it
5005_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> what i 've tried to lay out is a framework and i 'm hoping that people can just fill it in i 've sketched a sort of broad framework <unk> but wherever you are as i say if you 're in the travel industry do that travel bit if you 're in the communal industry look at religion and do the communal bit so it
5006_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> i grew up in orlando florida <unk> i was the son of an aerospace engineer <unk>
5007_AlaindeBotton_2011G,i lived and breathed the apollo program <unk> we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by
5008_AlaindeBotton_2011G,driving in the hour over to the cape <unk> i was impressed by obviously space and everything about it but i was most impressed by the engineering that went into it <unk>
5009_AlaindeBotton_2011G,behind me you see an amazing view a picture that was taken from the
5010_AlaindeBotton_2011G,international space station <unk> and it shows a portion of our planet that 's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored
5011_AlaindeBotton_2011G,that place is called the stratosphere
5012_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> if you start on the planet and you go up and up and up <unk> it gets colder and colder and colder
5013_AlaindeBotton_2011G,until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere and then an amazing thing happens
5014_AlaindeBotton_2011G,it gets colder at a much slower rate and then it starts warming up and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection
5015_AlaindeBotton_2011G,about zero degrees <unk> and then you end up getting colder and colder and that 's the top of the stratosphere
5016_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> one of the least accessible places on our planet most often when it 's visited it 's by astronauts who are blazing up at it
5017_AlaindeBotton_2011G,at probably several times the speed of sound and they get a few seconds on the way up and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in
5018_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> but the question i asked is is it possible to linger in the stratosphere <unk>
5019_AlaindeBotton_2011G,is it possible to experience the stratosphere is it possible to explore the stratosphere
5020_AlaindeBotton_2011G,i studied this using my favorite search engine for
5021_AlaindeBotton_2011G,quite a while about a year <unk> and then i made a scary phone call it was a reference from a friend of mine
5022_AlaindeBotton_2011G,to call taber maccallum from paragon space development corporation
5023_AlaindeBotton_2011G,<unk> and i asked him the question is it possible
5024_AlaindeBotton_2011G,to build
5025_AlaindeBotton_2011G,a system to go into the stratosphere <unk> and he said it was
5026_AlaindeBotton_2011G,and after a period of about three years we proceeded to do just that
5027_AlanEustace_2015,and on october twenty four of last year
5028_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> i went up in a balloon to one hundred and
5029_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> eight hundred and ninety feet but who 's counting
5030_AlanEustace_2015,came back to earth at speeds of up to eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour it was a four minute and
5031_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> descent <unk> and when i got to ten thousand feet i opened a parachute and i landed
5032_AlanEustace_2015,but this is really a science talk and it 's really an engineering talk <unk>
5033_AlanEustace_2015,and what was amazing to me about that experience is that taber said yes <unk> i think we can build a stratospheric suit <unk>
5034_AlanEustace_2015,and more than that come down tomorrow and let 's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it
5035_AlanEustace_2015,they did something which i think is important <unk> which is they took the analogy of scuba diving <unk> so in scuba diving <unk> you have a
5036_AlanEustace_2015,self contained system you have everything that you could ever need <unk> you have a scuba tank <unk>
5037_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> three years later this is what we have we 've got an amazing suit
5038_AlanEustace_2015,that was made by ilc dover ilc dover was the company that made all of the apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits they had never sold a suit commercially
5039_AlanEustace_2015,only to the government <unk> but they sold one to me which i am very grateful for
5040_AlanEustace_2015,up here we have a parachute this
5041_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> all about safety
5042_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> everyone on the team knew
5043_AlanEustace_2015,that i have a wife and two small children ten and fifteen
5044_AlanEustace_2015,and i wanted to come back safely <unk> so there 's a main parachute and a reserve parachute and if i do nothing
5045_AlanEustace_2015,the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device the suit itself can protect me from the
5046_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> cold this area in the front here has thermal protection it will actually heat water that will wrap around my body <unk> it has two redundant oxygen tanks even if i was to get a quarter inch hole in this suit which is extremely unlikely
5047_AlanEustace_2015,this system would still protect me from the
5048_AlanEustace_2015,from the low pressure of space the main advantage of this system is weight and complexity <unk> so the system weighs about
5049_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> five hundred pounds and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere <unk> they used a capsule <unk>
5050_AlanEustace_2015,and to do a capsule there 's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it <unk> and it weighed about three thousand pounds and to raise three thousand pounds
5051_AlanEustace_2015,to an altitude of one hundred and thirty five thousand feet which was my target altitude it would have taken a
5052_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> to fifty million cubic feet
5053_AlanEustace_2015,because i only weighed five hundred pounds in this system
5054_AlanEustace_2015,we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler
5055_AlanEustace_2015,than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon <unk>
5056_AlanEustace_2015,so with that i want to take you to roswell new mexico on october twenty four we had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night and
5057_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> here 's the suit <unk> again <unk> this is using the front loader that you 'll see in a second and i want to play you a video
5058_AlanEustace_2015,of the actual launch roswell 's a great place to launch balloons but it 's a fantastic place to land under a parachute <unk> especially when you 're going to land seventy miles away
5059_AlanEustace_2015,from the place you started that 's a helium truck in the background <unk> it 's darkness <unk> i 've already spent about an hour and a half
5060_AlanEustace_2015,a half pre breathing and then here you see the suit going on it takes about an hour to get the suit on
5061_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> astronauts get this really nice
5062_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> van to go to the launch pad but i got a front loader
5063_AlanEustace_2015,you can see the top you can see the balloon
5064_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> that 's where the helium is
5065_AlanEustace_2015,this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for fifteen miles
5066_AlanEustace_2015,and there we go that
5067_AlanEustace_2015,'s me waving with my left hand the reason i 'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway
5068_AlanEustace_2015,my team forbade me from using my right hand
5069_AlanEustace_2015,so the trip up is beautiful it 's kind of like google earth in reverse
5070_AlanEustace_2015,it took two hours and seven minutes to go up and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes i was mostly trying to relax
5071_AlanEustace_2015,my heart rate was very low
5072_AlanEustace_2015,and i was trying not to use very much oxygen
5073_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> you can see how the the fields in the background are relatively big at this point and you can see me going up and up <unk> it 's interesting here because if you look i 'm right over the airport and i 'm probably at fifty thousand feet
5074_AlanEustace_2015,but immediately i 'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over one hundred and twenty miles an hour <unk>
5075_AlanEustace_2015,this is my flight director telling me that i had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon <unk> and i was about four thousand feet from
5076_AlanEustace_2015,release this is what it looks like
5077_AlanEustace_2015,you can see the darkness of space the curvature of the earth the
5078_AlanEustace_2015,fragile planet below <unk>
5079_AlanEustace_2015,i 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now
5080_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> goes wrong i want to be ready and the main thing that i want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable
5081_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> there 's the balloon going by <unk> fully inflated at this point <unk>
5082_AlanEustace_2015,and there you can see a drogue parachute which i 'll demonstrate in just a second because that 's really important there 's the balloon going by a second time
5083_AlanEustace_2015,right now i 'm about at the speed of sound <unk>
5084_AlanEustace_2015,there 's nothing for me to tell it 's the speed of sound <unk> and very soon i will actually be as fast as i ever get eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour
5085_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there at this point i 'm very happy that there 's a parachute out
5086_AlanEustace_2015,i thought i was the only one happy but it turns out mission control was really happy as well
5087_AlanEustace_2015,the really nice thing about this is the moment i opened i had a close of friend of mine blikkies my parachute guy he flew in another airplane <unk> and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me
5088_AlanEustace_2015,he was my wingman on the descent
5089_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> this is my landing but it 's probably more properly called a crash
5090_AlanEustace_2015,i hate to admit it but this wasn 't even close to my worst landing
5091_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> you one thing that you might not have seen in that video <unk> but one
5092_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release and
5093_AlanEustace_2015,what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me
5094_AlanEustace_2015,and i 'll show you one of those right now <unk> if any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving <unk>
5095_AlanEustace_2015,you probably used one of these <unk>
5096_AlanEustace_2015,but the problem with one of these things
5097_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> right when you release you 're in zero gravity <unk>
5098_AlanEustace_2015,so it 's very easy for this to just turn right around you and before you know it you can be tangled up or spinning <unk>
5099_AlanEustace_2015,or you can release this drogue late
5100_AlanEustace_2015,in which case what happens is you 're going down at eight hundred miles an hour and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful <unk>
5101_AlanEustace_2015,but the guys at united parachute
5102_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> came up with this idea and it was a roll that looks like that but watch what happens when i pull it out <unk>
5103_AlanEustace_2015,it 's forming a pipe <unk>
5104_AlanEustace_2015,this pipe is so solid
5105_AlanEustace_2015,that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around and there 's no way it will ever tangle with you <unk>
5106_AlanEustace_2015,and that prevented a very serious
5107_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> so nothing is possible without an amazing team of people the core of this was about twenty people
5108_AlanEustace_2015,that worked on this for the three years <unk> and they were incredible people asked me what the best part of this whole thing was <unk> and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and
5109_AlanEustace_2015,environmental systems and high altitude medicine
5110_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> it was fantastic it 's an engineer 's dream to work with that group of people and i also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at google both
5111_AlanEustace_2015,for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that i was away but there 's one other group i wanted to thank and that 's my family yay
5112_AlanEustace_2015,i would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology and they weren 't hearing any
5113_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> of it it was super hard on them and the only reason that my wife
5114_AlanEustace_2015,put up with it was because i came back incredibly happy after each of the two hundred and fifty tests
5115_AlanEustace_2015,and she didn 't want to take that away from me <unk> so i want to close with a story my daughter katelyn <unk> my 15 year old she and i were in the car
5116_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> and we were driving down
5117_AlanEustace_2015,the road and she was sitting there <unk> and she had this idea and she goes dad i 've got this idea
5118_AlanEustace_2015,and so i listened to her idea and i said katelyn that 's impossible
5119_AlanEustace_2015,and she looks at me and she goes dad after what you just did how can you call anything impossible
5120_AlanEustace_2015,and i laughed <unk> and i said ok it 's not impossible it 's just very very hard and then i paused for a second and i said
5121_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> katelyn <unk> it may not be impossible it may not even be very very hard <unk> it 's just that i don 't know how to do it
5122_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> way to start i think with my view of simplicity is to
5123_AlanEustace_2015,take a look at ted here you are understanding why we 're here what 's going on
5124_AlanEustace_2015,with no difficulty at all the best a i in the planet would find it
5125_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> complex and confusing <unk> and my little dog watson
5126_AlanEustace_2015,would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point
5127_AlanEustace_2015,he would have a great time <unk> and of course if you 're a speaker
5128_AlanEustace_2015,here like hans rosling a speaker finds this complex tricky <unk> but in hans rosling 's case
5129_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> he had a secret weapon yesterday literally in his sword swallowing
5130_AlanEustace_2015,act <unk> and i must say i thought of quite a few objects that i might try to swallow
5131_AlanEustace_2015,today and finally gave up on but he just did it and that was
5132_AlanEustace_2015,a wonderful thing so puck meant
5133_AlanEustace_2015,not only are we fools in the pejorative sense but that we 're easily fooled in fact what
5134_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled <unk> so we 're actually looking forward to it
5135_AlanEustace_2015,we go to magic shows in order to be fooled <unk> and this makes
5136_AlanEustace_2015,many things fun <unk> but it makes it difficult
5137_AlanEustace_2015,to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves and our friend betty edwards the drawing on the
5138_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> right side of the brain lady shows these two tables to her
5139_AlanEustace_2015,drawing class and says the problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can 't move your hand but
5140_AlanEustace_2015,that the way your brain perceives images
5141_AlanEustace_2015,is faulty it 's trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what 's there and to prove it she says
5142_AlanEustace_2015,<unk> size and shape of these tabletops
5143_AlanKay_2007,is the same <unk> and i 'm going to prove it to you she does this with cardboard but since i have an expensive computer here i 'll
5144_AlanKay_2007,just rotate this little guy around and
5145_AlanKay_2007,now having seen that and i 've seen it hundreds of times because i use this in every talk i give i still can
5146_AlanKay_2007,<unk> that they 're the same size and shape and i doubt that you can either <unk> so what do artists do well what artists do is to measure
5147_AlanKay_2007,they measure very very carefully and if you measure very very carefully with a stiff arm
5148_AlanKay_2007,and a straight edge you 'll see that those two shapes are exactly the
5149_AlanKay_2007,same
5150_AlanKay_2007,<unk> the talmud
5151_AlanKay_2007,saw this a long time ago <unk> saying we see things
5152_AlanKay_2007,not as they are but as we are i certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight
5153_AlanKay_2007,back then if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion
5154_AlanKay_2007,so if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are then
5155_AlanKay_2007,what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here it 's a waking
5156_AlanKay_2007,<unk> dream <unk> and understanding that that is what
5157_AlanKay_2007,we actually exist in is
5158_AlanKay_2007,one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history <unk>
5159_AlanKay_2007,and what that means simple and understandable might not be actually simple or understandable and
5160_AlanKay_2007,things we think are complex might be made simple and understandable
5161_AlanKay_2007,somehow we have to understand ourselves to get
5162_AlanKay_2007,<unk> around our flaws we can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel
5163_AlanKay_2007,the way i think of it is we can 't learn to see until we admit we 're blind once you start
5164_AlanKay_2007,down at this very humble level then you can start
5165_AlanKay_2007,finding ways to see things and what 's happened over the last four hundred years in particular is that human beings have invented
5166_AlanKay_2007,little additional parts for our brain made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways and
5167_AlanKay_2007,these are in the form of sensory apparatus telescopes microscopes reasoning apparatus various ways of thinking
5168_AlanKay_2007,and most importantly in the ability to change perspective on things i 'll talk about that a little bit
5169_AlanKay_2007,it 's this change in perspective on what it is we think we 're perceiving
5170_AlanKay_2007,that has helped us make more progress in the last four hundred years than we have in the rest of human
5171_AlanKay_2007,history <unk> and yet
5172_AlanKay_2007,it is not taught in
5173_AlanKay_2007,any k through twelve curriculum in america that i 'm aware of
5174_AlanKay_2007,<unk> the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more
5175_AlanKay_2007,we like more if we do more in a kind of a stupid way the simplicity gets complex
5176_AlanKay_2007,and in fact <unk> we can keep on doing it for a very long time <unk>
5177_AlanKay_2007,but murray gell mann yesterday talked about emergent properties <unk> another name for them could be architecture as a metaphor
5178_AlanKay_2007,<unk> taking the same old material and thinking about
5179_AlanKay_2007,<unk> ways of combining it and in fact <unk> what murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty
5180_AlanKay_2007,of nature of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar all goes down to the
5181_AlanKay_2007,<unk> the idea that the elementary particles
5182_AlanKay_2007,are both sticky and standoffish <unk> and
5183_AlanKay_2007,they 're in violent motion those three things give rise to all the different levels of
5184_AlanKay_2007,what seem to be complexity in our world
5185_AlanKay_2007,<unk> a few years ago i just thought it was the greatest thing i 'd seen
5186_AlanKay_2007,in conveying complex ideas simply but then i had a thought of boy maybe it 's too simple and i put some effort in
5187_AlanKay_2007,to try and check
5188_AlanKay_2007,to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the
5189_AlanKay_2007,<unk> side and i found that they matched up very well <unk> so the roslings have been able to do simplicity
5190_AlanKay_2007,without removing what 's important about the data <unk> whereas the
5191_AlanKay_2007,the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell as a former molecular biologist
5192_AlanKay_2007,<unk> i didn 't like that at all not because it wasn 't beautiful or anything but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand
5193_AlanKay_2007,about molecular biology and that is why is there
5194_AlanKay_2007,any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed
5195_AlanKay_2007,and what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous <unk> they just swooped in the air and bound
5196_AlanKay_2007,<unk> something happened <unk>
5197_AlanKay_2007,but in fact those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second
5198_AlanKay_2007,they 're agitating back and forth their size
5199_AlanKay_2007,every two nanoseconds they 're completely crowded together they 're jammed they 're bashing up against each other
5200_AlanKay_2007,<unk> and if you don 't understand that in your mental model of this stuff
5201_AlanKay_2007,what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous and i think that 's exactly the wrong image
5202_AlanKay_2007,for when you 're trying to teach science <unk>
5203_AlanKay_2007,so another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication
5204_AlanKay_2007,with the actual understanding of some principle <unk> so a kid who 's fourteen in high school
5205_AlanKay_2007,gets this version of the pythagorean
5206_AlanKay_2007,theorem <unk> which is a truly subtle and interesting proof <unk> but in fact it 's not a good way to start learning about
5207_AlanKay_2007,mathematics so a more direct one one that gives you more of the feeling of math
5208_AlanKay_2007,<unk> is something closer to pythagoras <unk> ' own proof which goes like this so here we have this triangle and if we surround that
5209_AlanKay_2007,c square with three more triangles and we copy that notice that we can
5210_AlanKay_2007,move those triangles down like this and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious <unk>
5211_AlanKay_2007,and bingo <unk>
5212_AlanKay_2007,<unk> that is all you have to do <unk> and this kind of proof is the kind of proof
5213_AlanKay_2007,that you need to learn when you 're learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the literally <unk>
5214_AlanKay_2007,<unk> hundred or one thousand five hundred proofs of pythagoras ' theorem that have been discovered
5215_AlanKay_2007,now let 's go to young children this is a very unusual teacher who
5216_AlanKay_2007,was a kindergarten and
5217_AlanKay_2007,<unk> teacher but was a natural mathematician <unk> so she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific
5218_AlanKay_2007,musician she just had a feeling for math <unk> and
5219_AlanKay_2007,here are her six year olds and she 's got them
5220_AlanKay_2007,making shapes out of a shape so they pick a shape they like
5221_AlanKay_2007,<unk> like a diamond or a square or a triangle or a trapezoid and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape and the next larger shape you can see the trapezoids
5222_AlanKay_2007,are a little challenging there and what this teacher did on every project was to have the children
5223_AlanKay_2007,act like first it was a creative arts project and then something like science so they had created these artifacts now she had
5224_AlanKay_2007,<unk> them look at them and do this laborious <unk> which i thought
5225_AlanKay_2007,for a long time until she explained to me was to slow them down
5226_AlanKay_2007,so they 'll think so they 're cutting out the
5227_AlanKay_2007,little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up but the whole point of this thing is
5228_AlanKay_2007,for them to look at this chart
5229_AlanKay_2007,and fill it out what have you noticed about what you did
5230_AlanKay_2007,<unk> lauren there noticed that the first one took one and the second one took three more
5231_AlanKay_2007,and the total was four on that one the third one took five more
5232_AlanKay_2007,and the total was nine on that one and then the next one <unk> she saw right away that
5233_AlanKay_2007,the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by
5234_AlanKay_2007,<unk> so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there and she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six
5235_AlanKay_2007,where she wasn 't sure what six times six was
5236_AlanKay_2007,and what seven times seven was but then she was confident
5237_AlanKay_2007,again <unk> so that 's what lauren did and then the teacher <unk> gillian ishijima had the
5238_AlanKay_2007,kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor and everybody went batshit
5239_AlanKay_2007,<unk> shit <unk> they 're the same no matter what the shapes were the growth law
5240_AlanKay_2007,is the same <unk> and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize
5241_AlanKay_2007,these two progressions as a first order discrete differential equation and a second order discrete
5242_AlanKay_2007,differential equation
5243_AlanKay_2007,<unk> what we usually try to teach six year olds so let 's take a look now at
5244_AlanKay_2007,how we might use the computer for some of this and so the first
5245_AlanKay_2007,first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children
5246_AlanKay_2007,do i 'm using the software that we 're putting on the $ one hundred laptop
5247_AlanKay_2007,<unk> so i 'd like to draw a little car here i 'll just do this very quickly
5248_AlanKay_2007,and put a big
5249_AlanKay_2007,tire on him
5250_AlanKay_2007,and i get a little object here and i can look inside this object i 'll call it a car and here
5251_AlanKay_2007,<unk> little behavior car forward each time i click it car turn if i want to make a little script to do this over and over again i just drag these guys out
5252_AlanKay_2007,and set them going <unk>
5253_AlanKay_2007,and i can try steering the car here by see the car turn by five here <unk> so what if i click this down to zero it
5254_AlanKay_2007,goes straight that 's a big revelation for
5255_AlanKay_2007,nine year olds make it go in the other direction <unk> but of course that 's a little bit like kissing your sister as far as
5256_AlanKay_2007,driving a car so the kids want to do a steering wheel <unk> so they draw a steering wheel
5257_AlanKay_2007,and we 'll call this a wheel <unk>
5258_AlanKay_2007,<unk> this wheel 's heading here if i turn this wheel you can see that number over there going minus and positive
5259_AlanKay_2007,that 's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out
5260_AlanKay_2007,there and to just drop it into the script here and now i can
5261_AlanKay_2007,steer the car with the steering wheel and it
5262_AlanKay_2007,'s interesting you know how much trouble the children have with
5263_AlanKay_2007,<unk> but by learning it this way in a situated fashion they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it
5264_AlanKay_2007,and we can reflect here the way gillian ishijima did so
5265_AlanKay_2007,if you look at the little script here the speed is always going to be thirty we 're going to move the car according to that over and over again <unk>
5266_AlanKay_2007,and i 'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things they 're evenly
5267_AlanKay_2007,spaced because they 're thirty apart <unk>
5268_AlanKay_2007,and what if i do this progression that the <unk> six year olds did of saying ok <unk> i 'm going to increase the speed by two each time
5269_AlanKay_2007,and then i 'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time what do i get there
5270_AlanKay_2007,we get a visual pattern of what these nine year olds called acceleration <unk> so how do the children do science
5271_AlanKay_2007,<unk> not pay any attention to what anybody else
5272_AlanKay_2007,<unk> putting on
5273_AlanKay_2007,<unk> aristotle never asked a child
5274_AlanKay_2007,about this particular point because of course he didn 't bother doing the experiment and neither did <unk> st thomas aquinas and
5275_AlanKay_2007,it was not until galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child only four hundred
5276_AlanKay_2007,<unk> years ago <unk> we get one child like that about every classroom of thirty kids
5277_AlanKay_2007,who will actually cut straight to the chase now what if we want to look at this more closely <unk> we can take a movie
5278_AlanKay_2007,of what 's going on but even if we single stepped this movie it 's tricky to see what 's going on <unk>
5279_AlanKay_2007,and so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up <unk>
5280_AlanKay_2007,so when the children see
5281_AlanKay_2007,<unk> this they say ah acceleration
5282_AlanKay_2007,remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways <unk> and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration
5283_AlanKay_2007,so what i 'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image about a fifth of a second later
5284_AlanKay_2007,like that and they 're getting
5285_AlanKay_2007,<unk> faster and faster each time and if i stack these guys up
5286_AlanKay_2007,then we see the differences <unk> the increase in the speed
5287_AlanKay_2007,is constant and they say oh yeah constant acceleration we 've done that already <unk>
5288_AlanKay_2007,how shall we look and verify that we actually
5289_AlanKay_2007,have it so you can 't tell much from just making the ball
5290_AlanKay_2007,drop there <unk> but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time <unk>
5291_AlanKay_2007,we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model
5292_AlanKay_2007,galileo by the
5293_AlanKay_2007,<unk> did this
5294_AlanKay_2007,very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute
5295_AlanKay_2007,i pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that
5296_AlanKay_2007,this is actually
5297_AlanKay_2007,probably a newton and the apple type story but it 's a great story <unk> and i thought i would do just one thing
5298_AlanKay_2007,on the $ one hundred laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here
5299_AlanKay_2007,<unk> so once you have gravity here 's this
5300_AlanKay_2007,increase the speed by something increase the ship 's
5301_AlanKay_2007,speed if i start the little game here that the kids have done it 'll crash the space ship
5302_AlanKay_2007,but if i oppose gravity here we go
5303_AlanKay_2007,<unk> i 'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope
5304_AlanKay_2007,when we go to the physician today when we go to the doctor 's office and we walk in there are words that we just don 't want to hear <unk>
5305_AlanKay_2007,there are words that we 're truly afraid of
5306_AlanKay_2007,diabetes
5307_AlanKay_2007,<unk> cancer <unk> parkinson 's alzheimer 's heart failure lung failure things that we know
5308_AlanKay_2007,are debilitating diseases for which there 's relatively little that can be done <unk> and what i want to lay out for you today is
5309_AlanKay_2007,a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease <unk> why it 's important <unk> why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if if you think it already hasn
5310_AlanKay_2007,and where we are clinically today <unk> and where we might go tomorrow and what some of the hurdles are <unk> and we 're going to do all of that in eighteen minutes i promise
5311_AlanKay_2007,i want to start with this slide because this slide sort of tells the story the way science magazine thinks of it this was an issue from two thousand and two that they published with a lot of different articles
5312_AlanKay_2007,<unk> on the bionic human it was basically a regenerative medicine issue regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple
5313_AlanKay_2007,concept that everybody can understand it 's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale
5314_AlanKay_2007,<unk> so we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there
5315_AlanKay_2007,we know that if we have a damaged hip you can put an artificial hip in and this is the idea that science magazine used on their front cover <unk> this is the complete
5316_AlanKay_2007,<unk> antithesis of regenerative medicine this is not regenerative medicine
5317_AlanKay_2007,regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago the idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate <unk>
5318_AlanKay_2007,<unk> symptoms with devices and drugs and the like and i 'll come back to that theme a few times instead of doing that we will regenerate lost function of the body
5319_AlanKay_2007,<unk> by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue <unk> so that at the end of the treatment you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment
5320_AlanKay_2007,very few good ideas if you agree that this is a good idea very few good ideas are truly novel <unk> and this is just the same
5321_AlanKay_2007,if you look back in
5322_AlanKay_2007,<unk> charles lindbergh who was better known for flying airplanes was actually one of the first people along with alexis carrel one of the nobel laureates from rockefeller
5323_AlanKay_2007,to begin to think about could you culture organs and they published this book in <unk>
5324_AlanKay_2007,where they actually began to think about what could you do in <unk>
5325_AlanKay_2007,to grow whole organs <unk> we 've come a long way since
5326_AlanRussell_2006,i 'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that 's going on but before doing that what i 'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you
5327_AlanRussell_2006,many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life and reducing poverty and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe
5328_AlanRussell_2006,one of the challenges is is that the richer we are the longer we live <unk>
5329_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> and the longer we live the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older <unk> this is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population <unk>
5330_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> over the age of sixty five and you can basically see that the richer a country is
5331_AlanRussell_2006,population is thirty
5332_AlanRussell_2006,then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again maybe a little bit of asthma <unk> if the average age in your country is forty five to fifty five
5333_AlanRussell_2006,now the average person is looking at diabetes early onset diabetes heart failure coronary artery disease things that are inherently more difficult to treat and much more expensive to treat just have a look at the demographics in
5334_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> who were basically outside of being really sick paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease in two thousand and ten <unk>
5335_AlanRussell_2006,two workers per retiree in the u s and this is matched in every industrialized wealthy country
5336_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this this is age versus cost of health care <unk> and you can see that right around
5337_AlanRussell_2006,age forty five forty to forty five there 's a sudden spike in the cost of health care it
5338_AlanRussell_2006,'s actually quite interesting if you do the right studies
5339_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care plotted over your lifetime and about seven years before you 're about to die there 's a spike <unk>
5340_AlanRussell_2006,and you can actually
5341_AlanRussell_2006,there are very few things very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat
5342_AlanRussell_2006,these kinds of diseases and experience
5343_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> what i would call healthy aging i
5344_AlanRussell_2006,'d suggest there are four things and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system all those things do is change who pays <unk> they don 't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is
5345_AlanRussell_2006,one thing you can do is not treat you can ration health care <unk>
5346_AlanRussell_2006,we won 't talk about that anymore it 's too depressing you can prevent <unk> obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention
5347_AlanRussell_2006,but perhaps most interesting to me anyway and most important is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression <unk> and then <unk>
5348_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom think of it in terms of diabetes for instance
5349_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> for ten twenty thirty forty years and we do ok <unk> insulin 's a
5350_AlanRussell_2006,pretty good therapy but eventually it stops working and diabetes leads to a predictable
5351_AlanRussell_2006,onset of of debilitating disease <unk> why couldn 't we just inject the pancreas with something
5352_AlanRussell_2006,to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease perhaps even before it was symptomatic <unk> and it might be a little bit
5353_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> expensive at the time that we did it but if it worked <unk> we would truly be able to do something different
5354_AlanRussell_2006,this video <unk> i think gets across the concept that i 'm talking about quite dramatically <unk> this is a newt re growing its limb <unk>
5355_AlanRussell_2006,if a newt can do this kind of thing why can 't we i
5356_AlanRussell_2006,'ll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment but what we 're talking about in
5357_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body <unk> for tissues and for for organs themselves <unk>
5358_AlanRussell_2006,so today
5359_AlanRussell_2006,today 's reality is that if we get sick <unk> the message is we will treat your symptoms and you need to adjust to a new way of life
5360_AlanRussell_2006,i would pose to you that tomorrow
5361_AlanRussell_2006,and when tomorrow is we could debate <unk> but it
5362_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> 's within the foreseeable future we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation there 's a limb prosthetic up here similar actually one on the
5363_AlanRussell_2006,soldier that 's come back from iraq there are three hundred and seventy soldiers that have come back from iraq that have lost limbs <unk>
5364_AlanRussell_2006,imagine if instead of facing that they could actually face the regeneration of that
5365_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> it 's a wild concept i 'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept <unk>
5366_AlanRussell_2006,but it 's applicable again to every organ system how can we do that the way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body we need to learn to speak the body 's language
5367_AlanRussell_2006,and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus
5368_AlanRussell_2006,a mammalian fetus if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy will re grow that limb
5369_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> dna has the capacity
5370_AlanRussell_2006,to do these kinds of wound healing mechanisms it 's a natural process <unk> but it is lost as as we age
5371_AlanRussell_2006,in a child before the age of about six months if they lose their fingertip
5372_AlanRussell_2006,in an accident they 'll re grow their fingertip by the time they 're five they won 't be able to do
5373_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> so to engage in that conversation with the body we need to speak the body 's language and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today
5374_AlanRussell_2006,i 'm going to give you an example of three of these
5375_AlanRussell_2006,tools through which to converse with the body <unk> the first is cellular therapies <unk> clearly <unk>
5376_AlanRussell_2006,we heal ourselves in a natural process using cells to do most of the work
5377_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body <unk> they may do the healing
5378_AlanRussell_2006,secondly we can use materials we heard yesterday about the importance of new materials if we can invent materials <unk> design materials or extract materials <unk>
5379_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> from a natural environment then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself and finally we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal
5380_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> example of each of these and i 'm going to start with materials steve badylak who 's at the university of pittsburgh about a decade ago had a remarkable idea and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig <unk>
5381_AlanRussell_2006,if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all
5382_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself and he asked a very important question he asked the question if i take that material which is a natural <unk>
5383_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and i place it somewhere else on a person 's body
5384_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> response or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear <unk> i wouldn 't be telling you this story if it
5385_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> about to show you
5386_AlanRussell_2006,is a compelling picture
5387_AlanRussell_2006,however for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends the lights are down this is a good time to look at your feet
5388_AlanRussell_2006,check your blackberry do anything other than look at the screen what i 'm about to show you
5389_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> diabetic ulcer <unk> and although
5390_AlanRussell_2006,it 's good to laugh before we look at this this is the reality of diabetes i think a lot of times we hear about diabetics diabetic ulcers we just don 't connect
5391_AlanRussell_2006,the ulcer with the eventual treatment which is amputation if you can 't heal it so i 'm going to put the slide up now it won 't be up for long this is a
5392_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> the treatment for this is amputation this is an older lady she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes <unk> and has decided to die with what ' s left of her body intact <unk>
5393_AlanRussell_2006,and
5394_AlanRussell_2006,this lady decided after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer that she would try this this new therapy that steve invented that 's what the wound looked like eleven weeks later that material contained only natural signals <unk>
5395_AlanRussell_2006,and that material induced the body
5396_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> to switch back on a healing response that it didn 't have before there 's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you i 'll let you know when you can look again <unk>
5397_AlanRussell_2006,this is a horse the horse is not in pain <unk> if the horse was in pain i wouldn 't show you this slide the horse just has another nostril that 's developed because of a riding accident <unk>
5398_AlanRussell_2006,just a few weeks after treatment
5399_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> this case taking that material turning it into a gel
5400_AlanRussell_2006,and packing that area and then repeating the treatment a few times and the horse heals up and if you took an ultrasound of that area <unk> it would look great here 's a dolphin where the fin 's been re attached there are now four hundred thousand patients around the world
5401_AlanRussell_2006,who have used that material to heal their wounds could you regenerate a limb <unk> darpa just gave steve fifteen million
5402_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> project to begin the process of asking that question and i 'll show you the fifteen million dollar picture <unk>
5403_AlanRussell_2006,this is a seventy eight year old man who 's lost the end of his fingertip remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips <unk> after treatment that 's what it looks like
5404_AlanRussell_2006,this is happening today this is clinically relevant today <unk> there are materials that do this
5405_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> here are the heart patches but could you go a little further could you say instead of using material can i take some cells along with the material
5406_AlanRussell_2006,and remove a damaged piece of tissue put a bio degradable material on there you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish <unk> this was done by teruo okano <unk>
5407_AlanRussell_2006,at tokyo women 's hospital he can actually grow beating tissue in a dish <unk> he chills the dish <unk> it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish
5408_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> 'm going to show you cell based regeneration <unk>
5409_AlanRussell_2006,and what i 'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient again if you 're squeamish <unk> you don 't want to watch but this one 's kind of cool
5410_AlanRussell_2006,so <unk> this is a bypass operation just like what al gore had
5411_AlanRussell_2006,with a difference in this case at the end of the bypass operation you 're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure
5412_AlanRussell_2006,being injected directly into the heart of the patient
5413_AlanRussell_2006,and i 'm standing up here because at one point i 'm going to show you just how early this technology is here go the stem cells right into the beating heart of the patient and
5414_AlanRussell_2006,if you look really carefully it 's going to be right around this point you 'll actually see a back flush you see the cells coming back out
5415_AlanRussell_2006,we need all sorts of new technology new devices to get the cells to the right place
5416_AlanRussell_2006,at the right time
5417_AlanRussell_2006,just a little bit of data a tiny bit of data this was a randomized trial at this time this was an n of twenty now there 's an n of about one hundred
5418_AlanRussell_2006,basically if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass they get a little bit better if you give them stem cells as well as their bypass for these particular patients they became asymptomatic
5419_AlanRussell_2006,these are now two years out
5420_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> the coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early <unk>
5421_AlanRussell_2006,and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state <unk> this is the same procedure but now done minimally invasively with only three holes in the body where they 're taking <unk>
5422_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure there go the cells we don 't have time to go into all of those details <unk> but basically that works too you can take
5423_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> patients who are less sick <unk> and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
5424_AlanRussell_2006,through that kind of therapy <unk> here 's another example of stem cell therapy that isn 't quite clinical yet but i think very soon will be
5425_AlanRussell_2006,this is the work of kacey marra from pittsburgh <unk> along with a number of colleagues around the world they 've decided that liposuction fluid which in the united states we have a lot of liposuction fluid
5426_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> it 's a great source of stem cells stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid so you could go in you could get your tummy tuck
5427_AlanRussell_2006,out comes the liposuction fluid <unk> and in this case the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons
5428_AlanRussell_2006,all done in the lab <unk> and i think fairly soon you will see patients being treated with their
5429_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> i talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease here 's just one example before i close up this is equally tragic we have a very abiding and <unk>
5430_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army who have to treat the now eleven thousand
5431_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> treat it everything that is done to treat burn basically we do a sodding approach <unk> we
5432_AlanRussell_2006,make something over here <unk> and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound and we try and get the two to take
5433_AlanRussell_2006,in this case here a new wearable bio reactor has been designed it should be tested clinically later this year at isr
5434_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> will lay down in the wound bed <unk>
5435_AlanRussell_2006,the gun that you see there sprays cells that 's going to spray cells over that area the reactor will serve to fertilize the environment <unk> deliver other things as well at the same time
5436_AlanRussell_2006,and therefore we will seed
5437_AlanRussell_2006,that lawn as opposed to try the sodding approach it 's a completely different way of doing it
5438_AlanRussell_2006,so my eighteen minutes is up so let me finish up with some good news <unk> and maybe a little
5439_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> bit of bad news <unk> the good news
5440_AlanRussell_2006,is that this is happening today <unk> it 's very powerful work clearly the images kind of get that across it 's incredibly difficult because it 's highly inter disciplinary
5441_AlanRussell_2006,almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen a
5442_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> number of governments and a number of regions have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease the japanese government were perhaps the first when they decided to invest first three billion later another two billion
5443_AlanRussell_2006,in this field it 's no coincidence japan is the oldest country on earth in
5444_AlanRussell_2006,terms of its average age <unk> they need this to work or their health system dies <unk> so they 're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this
5445_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> the same thing china just launched a national tissue engineering center the first year budget was two hundred and fifty million us dollars
5446_AlanRussell_2006,in the united states we 've had a somewhat different approach
5447_AlanRussell_2006,oh for al gore to come and be in the real world as president <unk>
5448_AlanRussell_2006,we 've had a different approach and the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along but there 's been no strategic investment
5449_AlanRussell_2006,to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way
5450_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> we have public leaders <unk>
5451_AlanRussell_2006,public officials who are out of control <unk> they are writing bills that are unintelligible <unk> and out of these bills are going to come maybe forty thousand pages of
5452_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> which has a dramatically negative impact on our life if you 're a veteran coming back from iraq or vietnam
5453_AlanRussell_2006,you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits if you 're trying to get a small business loan you face a blizzard of paperwork what are we going to do about it
5454_AlanRussell_2006,i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity <unk> transparency and empathy
5455_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> building humanity into communications <unk> i 've been simplifying things for thirty years <unk>
5456_AlanRussell_2006,i come out of the advertising and design business my focus is understanding
5457_AlanRussell_2006,you people <unk> and how you interact with the government to get your benefits <unk> how you interact with corporations to decide whom you 're going to do business with <unk>
5458_AlanRussell_2006,and how you view brands so very quickly <unk> when president obama said i don 't see why we can
5459_AlanRussell_2006,one page plain english consumer credit agreement so i locked myself in a room <unk> figured out the content <unk>
5460_AlanRussell_2006,organized the document <unk> and wrote it in plain english <unk> i 've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country this is a real thing <unk>
5461_AlanRussell_2006,now
5462_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> i went one step further and said why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have
5463_AlanRussell_2006,a paper document let 's go online
5464_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> online and many people might need help in computation working with the harvard business school
5465_AlanRussell_2006,you 'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment <unk> if you spent sixty two dollars for a meal the longer you take to pay out that loan you see over a period of time using the minimum payment it 's
5466_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> dollars and seventeen cents <unk> how about that do you think your bank is going to show that to people <unk> but it 's going to work it 's more effective than just computational aids <unk> and what about
5467_AlanRussell_2006,terms like
5468_AlanRussell_2006,over the limit
5469_AlanRussell_2006,perhaps a stealth thing define it in context tell people what it means <unk> when you put it in plain english you almost force the institution to give the people a way a default out of that and not put themselves at
5470_AlanRussell_2006,<unk> plain english is about
5471_AlanRussell_2006,changing the content <unk> and one of the things i 'm most proud of is this agreement for ibm
5472_AlanRussell_2006,it 's a grid it 's a calendar at such and such a date <unk> ibm has responsibilities you have responsibilities <unk> received very favorably by by business <unk>
5473_AlanSiegel_2010,and there is some good news to report today <unk> each year one in ten taxpayers receives a notice from
5474_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> there are two hundred million letters that go out running through this typical letter that they had <unk> i ran it through my simplicity lab it 's pretty unintelligible all the
5475_AlanSiegel_2010,parts of the document in red are not intelligible <unk> we looked at doing over one thousand letters that cover seventy percent of their transactions in plain english they have been tested in the laboratory <unk> when i run it through my lab <unk>
5476_AlanSiegel_2010,this <unk>
5477_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> are a couple of things going on right now that i want to bring to your attention there is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency how to mandate simplicity we see all this complexity <unk>
5478_AlanSiegel_2010,it 's incumbent upon us <unk> and this organization i believe to make clarity
5479_AlanSiegel_2010,and empathy a national priority <unk> there is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate there is no way we should do business with companies that <unk>
5480_AlanSiegel_2010,have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible <unk> so <unk> how are we going to change the world make
5481_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> two thousand and three the uk government carried out a survey <unk>
5482_AlanSiegel_2010,and it was a survey that measured levels of numeracy in the population <unk> and they were shocked to find out that for every one hundred working age adults
5483_AlanSiegel_2010,in the country forty seven of them
5484_AlanSiegel_2010,lacked level one numeracy skills now level one numeracy skills that 's
5485_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> score it 's the ability to deal with fractions <unk> percentages and decimals so this figure prompted a lot of hand wringing in
5486_AlanSiegel_2010,whitehall policies were changed investments were made and then they ran the survey again in two thousand and eleven <unk> so can you guess what happened to this number
5487_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> it went up to forty nine and in fact when i reported this figure in the ft one of our readers joked and said this figure
5488_AlanSiegel_2010,is only shocking to fifty one percent of the population
5489_AlanSiegel_2010,but i preferred actually <unk> the reaction of a schoolchild when i presented at a school this information
5490_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> raised their hand and said how do we know that the person who made that number isn 't one of the forty nine percent either so
5491_AlanSiegel_2010,clearly there 's a numeracy issue because these are important skills for life and a lot of the changes that we want to introduce
5492_AlanSiegel_2010,in this century involve us becoming more comfortable with numbers <unk>
5493_AlanSiegel_2010,now <unk> it 's not just an english problem <unk> oecd this year released some figures looking at numeracy in young people
5494_AlanSiegel_2010,and leading the way <unk> the usa nearly
5495_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> forty percent of young people in the us have low numeracy now england is there too but there are <unk>
5496_AlanSiegel_2010,seven oecd countries with figures above twenty percent that is a problem because it doesn 't have to be that way if you look at the far end of this graph
5497_AlanSiegel_2010,you can see the netherlands and korea are in single figures
5498_AlanSiegel_2010,so there 's definitely
5499_AlanSiegel_2010,a numeracy problem that we want to address now
5500_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> useful as studies like these are i think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories that there are two kinds of people
5501_AlanSiegel_2010,those people that are comfortable with numbers that can do numbers <unk> and the people who can <unk>
5502_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> i 'm trying to talk about here today is to say that i believe that that
5503_AlanSiegel_2010,<unk> a false dichotomy <unk> it 's not an immutable pairing <unk>
5504_AlanSmith_2016X,i think you don 't have to have tremendously high levels of numeracy to be inspired by numbers <unk> and that that should be the starting point to the journey ahead
5505_AlanSmith_2016X,and one of the ways in which we can begin that journey for me is looking at statistics now i am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat of an image problem
5506_AlanSmith_2016X,laughter it 's the part of mathematics that even mathematicians don 't particularly like because whereas the rest of
5507_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> maths is all about precision and certainty statistics is almost the reverse of that <unk> but actually
5508_AlanSmith_2016X,i was a late convert to the world of statistics myself <unk> if you 'd asked my undergraduate professors what two
5509_AlanSmith_2016X,subjects would i be least likely to excel in after university they 'd have told you statistics and computer programming <unk> and yet here i am about to show you some statistical graphics that i programmed
5510_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> inspired that change in me what made me think that statistics was actually an interesting thing <unk>
5511_AlanSmith_2016X,it 's really because statistics are about us <unk> if you look at the etymology of the word statistics
5512_AlanSmith_2016X,it 's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in so statistics are about us as a group
5513_AlanSmith_2016X,not us as individuals and i think as social animals we share this fascination about how we as individuals
5514_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> relate to our groups to our peers and statistics in this way are at their most powerful when they surprise us
5515_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> and there 's been some really wonderful surveys carried out recently by ipsos mori in the last few years
5516_AlanSmith_2016X,they did a survey of over one thousand adults in the uk and said <unk> for every one hundred people in england and wales <unk> how many of them are muslim <unk>
5517_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> now the average answer from this survey which was supposed to be representative of the total population was
5518_AlanSmith_2016X,that 's what people thought british people think twenty four out of every one hundred people in the country are muslim now official figures
5519_AlanSmith_2016X,reveal that figure to be about five <unk>
5520_AlanSmith_2016X,so there 's this big variation between what we think our perception <unk> and the reality as as given by statistics and i think that 's interesting what could possibly be causing
5521_AlanSmith_2016X,that misperception
5522_AlanSmith_2016X,and i was so thrilled with this study i started to take questions out in presentations i was referring to it now <unk> i did a presentation at st paul 's school for girls in hammersmith <unk>
5523_AlanSmith_2016X,and i had an audience rather like this except it was comprised entirely of sixth form girls <unk> and i said
5524_AlanSmith_2016X,girls <unk>
5525_AlanSmith_2016X,how many
5526_AlanSmith_2016X,teenage girls do you think the british public think get pregnant every
5527_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> year and the girls were apoplectic when i said
5528_AlanSmith_2016X,the british public think that fifteen out of every one hundred teenage girls get pregnant in the year <unk>
5529_AlanSmith_2016X,and they had every right to be angry <unk> because in fact i 'd have to have closer to two hundred dots before i could color one in in terms of what the official figures tell us
5530_AlanSmith_2016X,and rather
5531_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> like numeracy this is not just an english problem <unk> ipsos mori expanded the survey in recent years
5532_AlanSmith_2016X,to go across the world <unk>
5533_AlanSmith_2016X,and so they asked saudi arabians for every one hundred adults in your country <unk> how many of them are overweight or obese <unk>
5534_AlanSmith_2016X,and the average answer from the saudis
5535_AlanSmith_2016X,was
5536_AlanSmith_2016X,just over a quarter that 's what they thought just over a quarter of
5537_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> overweight or obese the official figures show actually <unk> it 's nearer
5538_AlanSmith_2016X,to three quarters
5539_AlanSmith_2016X,so again a big variation <unk> and i love this one they asked in japan
5540_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> they asked the japanese for every one hundred japanese people how many of them live in rural areas <unk>
5541_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> the average was about a 50 50 split just over
5542_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> of every one hundred japanese people lived in rural areas <unk> the official figure is seven so
5543_AlanSmith_2016X,extraordinary variations and surprising to some but not surprising to people who have read the work of daniel kahneman for example the <unk>
5544_AlanSmith_2016X,economist he and his colleague <unk> amos tversky spent
5545_AlanSmith_2016X,years researching this disjoint between what people perceive and the reality the fact that people are actually pretty poor intuitive statisticians
5546_AlanSmith_2016X,and there are many reasons for this individual experiences certainly can influence our perceptions but so too can things like the media reporting things by exception
5547_AlanSmith_2016X,rather than what 's normal
5548_AlanSmith_2016X,kahneman had a nice way of referring to that he said we can be blind to the obvious so we 've got the numbers wrong but we can be blind to our blindness about it and that has enormous repercussions
5549_AlanSmith_2016X,for decision making so at the statistics office while
5550_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> this was all going on i thought this was really interesting i said this is clearly a global problem but maybe geography is the issue here
5551_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> these were questions that were all about how well do you know your country <unk> so in this case it 's
5552_AlanSmith_2016X,how well do you know <unk> sixty four million people not very well it turns out i can 't do that so i had an idea which was
5553_AlanSmith_2016X,to think about this same sort of approach but to think about it in a very local sense
5554_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> is this a local <unk> if we reframe the questions and say how well do you know your local area would your answers be any more accurate <unk>
5555_AlanSmith_2016X,so i devised a quiz <unk> how well do you know your area <unk>
5556_AlanSmith_2016X,it 's a simple web app you put in a post code and then it will ask you questions based on census data for your local
5557_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> and i was very conscious in designing this i wanted to make it
5558_AlanSmith_2016X,open to the widest possible range of people not just the forty nine percent who can get the numbers i wanted everyone to engage with it so for the design of the quiz
5559_AlanSmith_2016X,i was inspired by the isotypes of otto neurath from the 1920s and ' 30s now these
5560_AlanSmith_2016X,are methods for representing
5561_AlanSmith_2016X,numbers using repeating
5562_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> the numbers are there but they sit in the background
5563_AlanSmith_2016X,so it 's a great way of representing quantity without resorting to using terms like percentage fractions and ratios so
5564_AlanSmith_2016X,here 's the quiz <unk>
5565_AlanSmith_2016X,the layout of the quiz is you have your repeating icons on the <unk> left hand side there and a map showing you the area we 're asking you questions about on the right hand side there are seven questions
5566_AlanSmith_2016X,each question
5567_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> there 's a possible answer between zero and a hundred and at the end of the quiz you get an overall score between zero and a hundred and so because this is <unk>
5568_AlanSmith_2016X,i thought we would have a quick look at the quiz for the first few questions
5569_AlanSmith_2016X,of exeter and so the first question is for every one hundred people <unk> how many are aged under sixteen <unk>
5570_AlanSmith_2016X,now <unk> i don 't know exeter very well at all so i had a guess at this but it gives you an idea of how this quiz
5571_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> you drag the slider
5572_AlanSmith_2016X,to highlight your icons <unk>
5573_AlanSmith_2016X,and then just click submit to answer and we animate away the difference between your answer and reality <unk>
5574_AlanSmith_2016X,and it turns out i was a pretty terrible guess five <unk>
5575_AlanSmith_2016X,how about the next question this is asking about what the average age is so the age at which half the population are younger and half the population are older and i thought
5576_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> in exeter it 's incredibly young and i had underestimated the impact of the university
5577_AlanSmith_2016X,in this area <unk> the questions get harder as you go through <unk> so this one 's now asking about homeownership
5578_AlanSmith_2016X,for every one hundred households how many are owned with a mortgage or loan <unk> and i hedged my bets here because i didn 't want to be more than fifty out
5579_AlanSmith_2016X,on the answer
5580_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> these get harder these questions because when you 're in an area when you 're in a community things like age
5581_AlanSmith_2016X,there are clues to whether a population is old or young just by looking around the area you can see it something like homeownership
5582_AlanSmith_2016X,is much more difficult to see so we revert to our own heuristics our own biases about how many people we think own their own homes
5583_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> the truth is when we published this quiz <unk> the census data that it 's based on was already a few years old we 've had
5584_AlanSmith_2016X,online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years <unk> so in some senses this was all a little bit
5585_AlanSmith_2016X,old and and not necessarily new but i was interested to see
5586_AlanSmith_2016X,what reaction we might get by <unk> gamifying the data in the way that we have by using animation and playing on the fact that people have their own preconceptions
5587_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> it turns out <unk> the reaction was um
5588_AlanSmith_2016X,was more than i could have hoped for it was a long held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website due to public demand
5589_AlanSmith_2016X,laughter this url contains the words statistics gov and uk which are three of people 's least favorite words in a
5590_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> and the amazing thing about this was that the website came down
5591_AlanSmith_2016X,at quarter to ten at night because people were actually
5592_AlanSmith_2016X,engaging with this data of their own free will using their own personal time
5593_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> i was very interested to see that we got something like a quarter of a million
5594_AlanSmith_2016X,people playing the quiz within the space of forty eight hours of launching it and it sparked an enormous
5595_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> on social media which was largely dominated
5596_AlanSmith_2016X,by people having fun with their misconceptions which is something that i
5597_AlanSmith_2016X,i couldn 't have hoped for any better in some respects i also liked the fact that people started sending it to politicians <unk> how well do you know the area you claim to represent
5598_AlanSmith_2016X,and then just to finish
5599_AlanSmith_2016X,going back to the two kinds of people <unk> i thought it would be really interesting to see how people who are good with numbers would do on this quiz <unk> the national
5600_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> statistician of england and wales <unk> john pullinger you would expect he would be pretty good he got forty four for his own area
5601_AlanSmith_2016X,jeremy paxman
5602_AlanSmith_2016X,admittedly after a glass of wine thirty six even worse <unk> it just shows you that the numbers can inspire
5603_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> can surprise us all so very often we talk about statistics as being the science of uncertainty my parting thought for today is actually statistics is the science of us <unk> and that 's why we should be fascinated
5604_AlanSmith_2016X,by numbers thank you very much
5605_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> my dad
5606_AlanSmith_2016X,my dad has alzheimer 's disease <unk>
5607_AlanSmith_2016X,he started showing the symptoms about twelve years ago <unk> and he was officially diagnosed in two thousand and five
5608_AlanSmith_2016X,now he 's really pretty sick he needs help eating he needs help getting dressed
5609_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> dressed he doesn 't really know where he is or when it is
5610_AlanSmith_2016X,and it 's been really really hard
5611_AlanSmith_2016X,my dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life <unk> and i 've spent the last decade watching him disappear
5612_AlanSmith_2016X,my dad 's not alone there 's about
5613_AlanSmith_2016X,thirty five million people globally living with some kind of dementia <unk> and by two thousand and thirty they 're expecting that to double
5614_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> to seventy million that 's a lot of people
5615_AlanSmith_2016X,dementia scares us the confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia <unk> the big numbers of people who get it <unk>
5616_AlanSmith_2016X,they frighten us <unk> and because of that fear
5617_AlanSmith_2016X,we tend to do one of two things
5618_AlanSmith_2016X,we go into denial it 's not me <unk> it has nothing to do with me it 's never going to happen to me
5619_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> decide that we 're going to prevent dementia <unk> and it will never happen to us because we 're going to do everything right and it won 't come and get us <unk>
5620_AlanSmith_2016X,i 'm looking for a third way <unk> i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease <unk>
5621_AlanSmith_2016X,prevention is good <unk> and i 'm doing the things that you can do to prevent alzheimer 's <unk> i 'm eating right <unk> i 'm
5622_AlanSmith_2016X,<unk> i 'm keeping my mind active that 's what the research says you should do but the research also shows that there 's nothing that will one hundred percent protect you
5623_AlanSmith_2016X,if the monster wants you the monster 's gonna get you
5624_AlanSmith_2016X,that 's what happened with my dad my dad was a bilingual college professor his hobbies were chess bridge and writing op eds
5625_AlanSmith_2016X,he got dementia anyway if the monster wants you the monster 's gonna get
5626_AlanSmith_2016X,especially if you 're me ' cause alzheimer 's tends to run in families <unk>
5627_AlanSmith_2016X,so i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease <unk>
5628_AlannaShaikh_2012G,based on what i 've learned from taking care of my father and researching what it 's like to live with dementia <unk> i 'm focusing on three things in my preparation <unk>
5629_AlannaShaikh_2012G,i 'm changing what i do for fun <unk>
5630_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> i 'm working to build my physical strength <unk> and this is the hard one i 'm trying to become a better person <unk>
5631_AlannaShaikh_2012G,let 's start with the hobbies
5632_AlannaShaikh_2012G,when you get dementia <unk> it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself you can 't sit and have long talks with your old friends because you don 't know who they are
5633_AlannaShaikh_2012G,it 's confusing to watch television and often very frightening <unk> and reading is just about impossible
5634_AlannaShaikh_2012G,when you care for someone with dementia and you get training
5635_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar
5636_AlannaShaikh_2012G,with my dad <unk> that turned out to be letting him fill out forms
5637_AlannaShaikh_2012G,he was a college professor at a state school he knows what paperwork looks like <unk>
5638_AlannaShaikh_2012G,he 'll sign his name on every line he 'll check all the
5639_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> 'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers but it got me thinking what would my caregivers do with me
5640_AlannaShaikh_2012G,i 'm my father 's daughter <unk> i read i write <unk> i think about global health a lot
5641_AlannaShaikh_2012G,would they give me academic journals so i could scribble in the margins would they give me charts and graphs that i could color <unk>
5642_AlannaShaikh_2012G,so i 've been trying to learn to do things that are hands on i 've always liked to draw so i 'm doing it more even though i 'm really very bad at it
5643_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> i am learning some basic origami i can make a really great box
5644_AlannaShaikh_2012G,and i 'm teaching myself to knit which so far i can knit a blob but you
5645_AlannaShaikh_2012G,know it doesn 't matter <unk> if i 'm actually good at it what matters is that my hands know how to do it because the more things that are familiar
5646_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> the more things my hands know how to do the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain 's not running the show anymore
5647_AlannaShaikh_2012G,they say that people who are engaged in activities are happier <unk> easier for their caregivers to look after and
5648_AlannaShaikh_2012G,it may even slow the progress of the disease <unk>
5649_AlannaShaikh_2012G,that all seems like win to me <unk> i want to be as happy as i can for as long as i can
5650_AlannaShaikh_2012G,a lot of people don 't know that alzheimer 's actually has physical symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms
5651_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> lose your sense of balance <unk> you get muscle tremors <unk>
5652_AlannaShaikh_2012G,and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile <unk> they get scared to walk around <unk> they get scared to move <unk>
5653_AlannaShaikh_2012G,so i 'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance <unk> i 'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance so that when i start to lose it i
5654_AlannaShaikh_2012G,'ll still be able to be mobile <unk>
5655_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> so that i have the muscle strength so that when i start to wither <unk> i have more time that i can still move around <unk>
5656_AlannaShaikh_2012G,finally the third thing i 'm trying to become a better person
5657_AlannaShaikh_2012G,my dad was kind and loving before he had alzheimer 's <unk> and he 's kind and loving now
5658_AlannaShaikh_2012G,i 've seen him lose his intellect his sense of humor <unk> his language skills but i 've also seen this <unk> he
5659_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> he loves my sons <unk> he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers <unk>
5660_AlannaShaikh_2012G,and that love makes us want to be around him even now even when it 's so hard when you take away everything
5661_AlannaShaikh_2012G,that he ever learned in this world his naked heart still shines
5662_AlannaShaikh_2012G,i was never as kind as my dad <unk> and i was never as loving <unk>
5663_AlannaShaikh_2012G,and what i need now is to learn to be like that i need a heart so pure that if it 's stripped bare by dementia
5664_AlannaShaikh_2012G,it will survive
5665_AlannaShaikh_2012G,i don 't want to get alzheimer 's disease <unk> what i want is a cure in the next twenty years soon enough to protect me
5666_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> but if it comes for me <unk> i 'm going to be ready <unk> thank you
5667_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> what we usually mean is a professional <unk>
5668_AlannaShaikh_2012G,someone who gets paid <unk>
5669_AlannaShaikh_2012G,and we tend to assume that it 's those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big systemic design challenges that we face like climate change
5670_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> urbanization and social inequality
5671_AlannaShaikh_2012G,that 's our kind of working presumption <unk> and i think it 's wrong <unk> actually <unk>
5672_AlannaShaikh_2012G,in two thousand and eight i was just about to graduate from architecture school after several years <unk> and go out and get a job <unk> and
5673_AlannaShaikh_2012G,this happened the economy ran out of jobs <unk> and a couple of things struck me about this one don 't listen to career advisers
5674_AlannaShaikh_2012G,and two actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture
5675_AlannaShaikh_2012G,which is that as a society we 've never needed design thinking more and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed
5676_AlannaShaikh_2012G,it strikes me that we talk very deeply about design but actually there 's an economics behind architecture that we don 't talk about and i think we need to
5677_AlannaShaikh_2012G,and a good place to start is your own paycheck
5678_AlannaShaikh_2012G,<unk> so as a bottom of the rung architecture graduate i might expect to earn about twenty four thousand pounds that 's about thirty six thousand thirty seven thousand dollars
5679_AlannaShaikh_2012G,now in terms of the whole world 's population that already puts me in the top one point nine five richest people <unk>
5680_AlannaShaikh_2012G,which raises the question of who is it i 'm working for
5681_AlannaShaikh_2012G,the uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture
5682_AlannaShaikh_2012G,today
5683_AlannaShaikh_2012G,is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world 's population <unk> and it always has been
5684_AlannaShaikh_2012G,the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when
5685_AlannaShaikh_2012G,actually the one percent would build on behalf of the ninety nine percent for various different reasons whether that was through philanthropy in the
5686_AlannaShaikh_2012G,the welfare state <unk> and most recently of course <unk> through this inflated real estate bubble
5687_AlannaShaikh_2012G,and all of those booms in their own various ways have now kicked the bucket <unk> and we 're back in this situation
5688_AlannaShaikh_2012G,where
5689_AlannaShaikh_2012G,the smartest designers and architects in the world are only
5690_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> really able to work for one percent of the population
5691_AlastairParvin_2013,now it 's not just that that 's bad for democracy though i think it probably is it 's actually not a very clever business strategy actually
5692_AlastairParvin_2013,i think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is how are we going to turn our client from the one percent
5693_AlastairParvin_2013,to the one hundred percent <unk>
5694_AlastairParvin_2013,and i want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done <unk>
5695_AlastairParvin_2013,the first is i think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings
5696_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> actually a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem <unk>
5697_AlastairParvin_2013,and fundamentally design should be much much more interested in solving problems and creating new conditions so here 's a story <unk> the office was working with a school and they had an old victorian school building <unk>
5698_AlastairParvin_2013,and
5699_AlastairParvin_2013,they said to the architects look our corridors are an absolute nightmare they 're far too small they get congested between classes there 's bullying
5700_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> 't control them <unk> so what we want you to do is re plan our entire building and we know it 's going to cost several million pounds but we 're reconciled to the fact
5701_AlastairParvin_2013,and the team thought about this and they went away and they said actually <unk> don 't do that instead get rid of the school bell
5702_AlastairParvin_2013,and instead of having one school bell that goes off once have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times distribute the traffic through the corridors
5703_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> solves the same problem <unk> but instead of spending several million pounds <unk> you spend several hundred pounds <unk>
5704_AlastairParvin_2013,now it looks like you 're doing yourself out of a job but you 're not you 're actually making yourself more useful architects are actually really really good at this kind of resourceful strategic thinking
5705_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> and the problem is that like a lot of design professions we got fixated on the idea of providing a particular kind of consumer product <unk> and i don 't think that needs to be the case anymore
5706_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> the second idea worth questioning is this 20th century thing
5707_AlastairParvin_2013,that mass architecture is about big big buildings and big finance
5708_AlastairParvin_2013,actually we 've got ourselves locked into this industrial era mindset which says that
5709_AlastairParvin_2013,the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf procuring whole neighborhoods in single <unk> monolithic projects and of course
5710_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> form follows finance <unk> so what you end up with are single monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of <unk>
5711_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> model <unk> and a lot of people can 't even afford them <unk>
5712_AlastairParvin_2013,but what if actually it 's possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit <unk>
5713_AlastairParvin_2013,and when they do they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live
5714_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> and it raises really interesting questions about how will we plan cities how will finance development how will we sell design services what would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build
5715_AlastairParvin_2013,and in a way it should be kind of obvious right that
5716_AlastairParvin_2013,in the 21st century maybe cities can be developed by citizens
5717_AlastairParvin_2013,and thirdly we need to remember that from a strictly economic point of view
5718_AlastairParvin_2013,design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly
5719_AlastairParvin_2013,mostly it 's done by amateurs <unk>
5720_AlastairParvin_2013,and that 's a good thing
5721_AlastairParvin_2013,most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what 's called the social economy or the core economy which is people doing it for themselves <unk>
5722_AlastairParvin_2013,and
5723_AlastairParvin_2013,the problem is that up until now it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools
5724_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> so the challenge we face is how are we going to build the tools the infrastructure and the institutions for architecture 's social economy <unk> and that began with open source software <unk>
5725_AlastairParvin_2013,and over the last few years it 's been moving into the physical world with open source hardware which are freely shared blueprints that anyone can download and make for themselves <unk>
5726_AlastairParvin_2013,and that 's where 3d printing gets really really interesting right when suddenly you had
5727_AlastairParvin_2013,a 3d printer that was open source the parts for which could be made on another 3d printer
5728_AlastairParvin_2013,or the same idea here which is for a cnc machine which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood
5729_AlastairParvin_2013,what these technologies are doing is radically lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill <unk> they 're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it 's got to be
5730_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities
5731_AlastairParvin_2013,we 're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere <unk> and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone
5732_AlastairParvin_2013,that really is an industrial revolution and when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all
5733_AlastairParvin_2013,based around this question of who should control the means of production and these technologies are coming back with a solution <unk> actually <unk> maybe no one all of us <unk>
5734_AlastairParvin_2013,and we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture
5735_AlastairParvin_2013,so about a year and a half ago <unk> we started working on a project called wikihouse and wikihouse is an open source construction system
5736_AlastairParvin_2013,and the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go
5737_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> access a freely shared library of 3d models
5738_AlastairParvin_2013,which they can download and adapt in at the moment sketchup because it 's free and it 's easy to use <unk> and almost at the click of a switch
5739_AlastairParvin_2013,they can generate a set of cutting files
5740_AlastairParvin_2013,which allow them in effect to print out the parts from a house using a cnc machine and a standard sheet material like plywood <unk> and
5741_AlastairParvin_2013,the parts are all numbered <unk> and basically what you end up with is a really big ikea kit
5742_AlastairParvin_2013,and it goes together without any bolts <unk> it uses wedge and peg connections <unk> and even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well <unk>
5743_AlastairParvin_2013,and a team of about two or three people working together can build this they don 't need any traditional construction skills
5744_AlastairParvin_2013,they don 't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that and they can build a small house of about this size
5745_AlastairParvin_2013,in about a day
5746_AlastairParvin_2013,and what you end up with is just the basic <unk>
5747_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what 's cheap and what 's available
5748_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> our heads here so the house is not a finished product with the cnc machine you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door so we can begin to see the seed of a completely <unk>
5749_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> citizen led urban development model potentially <unk> and we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now
5750_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> some really interesting lessons here <unk> one of them is that it 's always incredibly sociable people get confused between construction work and having fun
5751_AlastairParvin_2013,but the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane physical details
5752_AlastairParvin_2013,like never designing a piece that can 't be lifted up or when you 're designing a piece make sure you either can 't put it in the wrong way round or if you do it doesn 't matter because it 's symmetrical
5753_AlastairParvin_2013,probably the principal which
5754_AlastairParvin_2013,runs deepest with us
5755_AlastairParvin_2013,is the
5756_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> principal set out by linus torvalds the open source pioneer <unk>
5757_AlastairParvin_2013,which was that idea of be lazy like a fox don 't reinvent the wheel every time take what already works and adapt it for your own needs <unk>
5758_AlastairParvin_2013,contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school copying is good
5759_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> which is appropriate <unk>
5760_AlastairParvin_2013,because actually this approach is not innovative it 's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the industrial revolution in these sorts of community barn raisings the only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open source architecture
5761_AlastairParvin_2013,might be a web connection <unk> but it 's a really really big difference
5762_AlastairParvin_2013,we shared the whole of wikihouse under a creative commons license and now what 's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it and it 's amazing there 's a
5763_AlastairParvin_2013,cool group over in christchurch in new zealand looking at post earthquake development housing <unk> and thanks to the ted
5764_AlastairParvin_2013,city prize we 're working with an awesome group in one of rio 's favelas to set up a
5765_AlastairParvin_2013,kind of community factory and and micro university these are very very small beginnings <unk> and
5766_AlastairParvin_2013,actually there 's more people in the last week who have got in touch and they 're not even on this map i hope next time you see it you
5767_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> we 're aware that wikihouse is a very very small answer
5768_AlastairParvin_2013,but it 's a small answer to a really really big question which is that globally right now the fastest growing cities
5769_AlastairParvin_2013,are not skyscraper cities they 're self made cities
5770_AlastairParvin_2013,in one form or another if
5771_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> these are the guys who are going to be making it you know like it or not welcome to the world 's biggest design team
5772_AlastairParvin_2013,so if we 're serious about problems like climate change urbanization and health <unk>
5773_AlastairParvin_2013,actually <unk> our existing development models aren 't going to do it
5774_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> as i think robert neuwirth said there isn 't a bank or a corporation or a government or an ngo who 's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers
5775_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> how extraordinary would it be though if collectively
5776_AlastairParvin_2013,we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we 've been working on but to infrastructure problems like
5777_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> by everyone and they 're accessible by everyone a kind of
5778_AlastairParvin_2013,wikipedia for stuff <unk>
5779_AlastairParvin_2013,and once something 's in the commons it will always be there how much would that change the rules <unk> and i think the technology 's on our side
5780_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> i work for the red cross and
5781_AlastairParvin_2013,i 'm a physical therapist my job is to make
5782_AlastairParvin_2013,arms and legs well it 's not completely true <unk> we do more than that we provide the
5783_AlastairParvin_2013,patients the afghan disabled first with the physical rehabilitation
5784_AlastairParvin_2013,then with the social reintegration <unk> it 's a very logical plan <unk>
5785_AlastairParvin_2013,but it was not always like this for many years we were just providing them with
5786_AlastairParvin_2013,artificial limbs <unk> it took
5787_AlastairParvin_2013,quite
5788_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> for the program to become what it is now <unk> today i would like to
5789_AlastairParvin_2013,to tell you a story the story of a big change <unk> and the story of the people who made this change possible
5790_AlastairParvin_2013,i arrived in afghanistan in one thousand nine hundred and ninety
5791_AlastairParvin_2013,to work in a hospital for
5792_AlastairParvin_2013,<unk> not only for war victims but it was for any kind of patient <unk> i was also working in
5793_AlastairParvin_2013,the orthopedic center we call it this is the place where we make the legs at that time
5794_AlastairParvin_2013,i found myself
5795_AlastairParvin_2013,in a strange situation <unk> i felt not quite ready for that job <unk> there was so much to learn
5796_AlastairParvin_2013,there were so many things new to me but it was a terrific job
5797_AlastairParvin_2013,but as soon as the fighting intensified the physical rehabilitation was suspended there were many other things to do
5798_AlastairParvin_2013,so the orthopedic center was closed
5799_AlastairParvin_2013,because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority
5800_AlastairParvin_2013,every time i i make this speech it 's not the first time but it 's an emotion it 's something that comes comes out from the past
5801_AlastairParvin_2013,displaced people <unk> but one day something happened <unk> i was
5802_AlastairParvin_2013,coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque
5803_AlbertoCairo_2011X,where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions <unk> i wanted to go home i was driving
5804_AlbertoCairo_2011X,<unk> forget you don 't want to see things so you just want to to go to your room to lock yourself inside and say that 's enough
5805_AlbertoCairo_2011X,a bomb fell not far from my car well far enough but big noise and
5806_AlbertoCairo_2011X,everybody disappeared from the street the cars disappeared as well i ducked and
5807_AlbertoCairo_2011X,<unk> only one figure remained in the middle of the road it was a man in a wheelchair
5808_AlbertoCairo_2011X,desperately trying to
5809_AlbertoCairo_2011X,to move away well i 'm not a particularly brave person i have to confess it but
5810_AlbertoCairo_2011X,i could not just ignore him <unk> so i stopped the car
5811_AlbertoCairo_2011X,<unk> i went to help <unk> the man was
5812_AlbertoCairo_2011X,without legs
5813_AlbertoCairo_2011X,and only with one arm <unk> behind him there was a child his son red in the face in an effort to
5814_AlbertoCairo_2011X,to push the father <unk> so i took him into a safe place and
5815_AlbertoCairo_2011X,i ask what are you doing out in the
5816_AlbertoCairo_2011X,<unk> and then i ask an
5817_AlbertoCairo_2011X,even more stupid question why don 't you have the prostheses <unk> why don 't you have the artificial legs and he said the red cross has closed
5818_AlbertoCairo_2011X,well without thinking <unk> i told him come tomorrow <unk> we will provide you with a
5819_AlbertoCairo_2011X,<unk> my god what did i say <unk> the center is closed no staff around <unk> maybe the machinery
5820_AlbertoCairo_2011X,is broken who is going to make the legs for him so i hoped that
5821_AlbertoCairo_2011X,<unk> he would not come this is the streets of kabul
5822_AlbertoCairo_2011X,in those days <unk> so i
5823_AlbertoCairo_2011X,said well i will give him some money and so the following day <unk> i went to the orthopedic center <unk> and i spoke with a
5824_AlbertoCairo_2011X,gatekeeper <unk> i was ready to tell him listen if someone such and such comes
5825_AlbertoCairo_2011X,<unk> tell him that it was a mistake nothing can be done
5826_AlbertoCairo_2011X,give him some money but mahmoud and his son were already there <unk> and they were not alone
5827_AlbertoCairo_2011X,there were fifteen <unk> maybe twenty people like him
5828_AlbertoCairo_2011X,waiting and there was some staff too among them there was my right hand man najmuddin
5829_AlbertoCairo_2011X,<unk> we have to go away we cannot stay here they were bombing not very close but you could hear the noise of the bombs so we cannot stay here it 's dangerous <unk> it 's not a priority
5830_AlbertoCairo_2011X,but najmuddin told me listen now we 're here at least we can start repairing the prostheses the broken prostheses of the people and maybe
5831_AlbertoCairo_2011X,try to do something for people like
5832_AlbertoCairo_2011X,we cannot do that <unk> it 's really dangerous <unk> we have other things to do but they insisted <unk> when you have
5833_AlbertoCairo_2011X,twenty people
5834_AlbertoCairo_2011X,in front of you looking at you and you are the the one who has to decide <unk>
5835_AlbertoCairo_2011X,so we started doing some repairs also one of the physical therapists reported that
5836_AlbertoCairo_2011X,could
5837_AlbertoCairo_2011X,be provided with a leg but not immediately the legs were swollen and the knees were stiff so he needed a long preparation
5838_AlbertoCairo_2011X,believe me i was worried because i was breaking the rules i was doing something that
5839_AlbertoCairo_2011X,i was not supposed to do in the evening i went to to speak with the bosses at the headquarters and i told them i lied

6074_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and i can summarize three point five billion years of the history of life on this planet in a single slide what you see here are representatives of all known species in our planet
6075_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,in this immensity of life and biodiversity <unk> we occupy a rather unremarkable position
6076_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> homo sapiens
6077_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,the last of our kind <unk>
6078_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and though i don 't really want to disparage at all the accomplishments of our species <unk> as much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is
6079_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,we are not the measure of all things <unk>
6080_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,we are however the measurers of many things <unk> we relentlessly
6081_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> analyze and compare <unk> and some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary <unk>
6082_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,but this emphasis today on forcing biological research to specialize
6083_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and to produce practical outcomes is actually restricting our ability to interrogate life to unacceptably narrow confines and unsatisfying depths
6084_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,we are measuring
6085_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,an astonishingly narrow sliver of life and hoping that those
6086_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> numbers will save all of our lives how narrow do you ask well let me give you a number
6087_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently estimated that about ninety five percent of our oceans remain unexplored
6088_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,now let that sink in for a second
6089_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> very safe to say that we don 't even know how much about life we do not know
6090_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,so it 's not surprising that every week in my field we begin to see the addition of more and more new species to this amazing tree of life
6091_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,this one for example discovered earlier this summer
6092_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,new to science and now occupying its lonely branch in our family tree
6093_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,what is even more tragic is that we know about
6094_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> a bunch of other species of animals out there <unk> but their biology remains sorely under studied
6095_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,i 'm sure some of you have heard about the fact that a starfish can actually regenerate its arm after it 's lost <unk> but some of you might not know that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish <unk>
6096_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and there are animals out there that do truly astounding things
6097_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> willing to bet that many of you have never heard of the flatworm
6098_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> little guy right here
6099_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,does things that essentially just blow my mind
6100_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,you can grab one of these animals and cut it into eighteen different fragments and each and every one of those fragments will go on to regenerate a
6101_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> for the past decade and a half or so i 've been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do and how they pull this magic trick off but like all good magicians
6102_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,they 're not really releasing their secrets readily to me
6103_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,so here we are after twenty years of essentially
6104_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,studying these animals genome mapping <unk> chin scratching
6105_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> and thousands of amputations and thousands of regenerations
6106_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,we still don 't fully understand how these animals do what they do each planarian an ocean unto itself
6107_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,full of unknowns
6108_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,one of the common characteristics of all of these animals i 've been talking to you about is that they did not appear to have received the memo
6109_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,that they need to behave according to the rules that we have
6110_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> derived from a handful of randomly selected animals that currently populate the vast majority of biomedical laboratories across the world <unk>
6111_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,meet our nobel prize winners seven species essentially
6112_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,that have produced for us the brunt of our understanding of biological behavior today <unk>
6113_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,this little guy right here
6114_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,three nobel prizes in twelve years
6115_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> and yet <unk> after all the attention they have garnered and all the knowledge they have generated as well as the lion 's share of the funding
6116_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,here we are standing [ before ] the same litany of intractable problems and many new challenges <unk>
6117_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and that 's because unfortunately these seven animals essentially correspond
6118_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,to zero point zero zero zero nine percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet
6119_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,so i 'm beginning to suspect that our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best <unk>
6120_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and at worst is leading us astray <unk>
6121_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,that 's because life on this planet and its history is the history of rule breakers
6122_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,life started on the face of this planet as single cell organisms swimming for millions of years in the ocean until one of those creatures decided i 'm going to do
6123_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> things differently today today i would like to invent something called multicellularity <unk> and i 'm going to do this and i 'm sure it wasn 't a popular decision at the time but somehow
6124_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,it managed to do it and then <unk> multicellular organisms began to populate all these ancestral oceans <unk> and they thrived <unk> and we have them here today <unk>
6125_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,land masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans <unk> and another creature thought
6126_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> of real estate <unk> i 'd like to move there are you crazy you 're going to desiccate out there nothing can live out of water but life found a way <unk>
6127_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and there are organisms now that live on land <unk> once on land they may have looked up into the sky and <unk>
6128_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> the clouds <unk> i 'm going to fly you can 't break the law of gravity there 's no way you can fly
6129_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and yet nature has invented multiple and independent times ways to fly
6130_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,i love to study these animals that break the rules because every time they break a rule they invent something new that made it possible for us to be able to be here today <unk> these animals did not get the memo they break the rules <unk>
6131_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,so if we 're going to study animals that break the rules <unk> shouldn 't how we study them also break the
6132_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> i think we need to renew our spirit of exploration <unk> rather than bring nature into our laboratories and interrogate it there <unk> we need to bring our science into the majestic laboratory that is nature <unk>
6133_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and there with our modern technological armamentarium <unk> interrogate every new form of life we find <unk> and any new biological attribute that we may find <unk>
6134_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,we actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again
6135_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,the immensity of the unknown <unk>
6136_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,because after all science is not really about knowledge science is about ignorance that 's what we do <unk> once
6137_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> wrote if you want to build a ship don 't drum up people to collect wood and don 't assign them tasks and work <unk> but rather teach them to long for the endless
6138_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> immensity of the sea as
6139_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,a scientist and a teacher <unk> i like to paraphrase this to read that we scientists need to teach our students to long for the endless immensity of the sea that is our ignorance <unk>
6140_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,we homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry
6141_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> like all other species on this planet are inextricably woven into the history of life on this planet
6142_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and i think i 'm a little wrong when i say that life is a mystery <unk>
6143_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,because i think that life is actually an open secret that has been beckoning our species for millennia to understand it
6144_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,so i ask you aren
6145_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,'t we the best chance that life has to know itself <unk> and if so <unk> what the heck are we waiting for thank you
6146_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> any power in design that 's the power of synthesis <unk> the more complex the problem <unk> the more the need for simplicity <unk>
6147_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,so allow me to share three cases where we tried to apply design 's power of synthesis <unk>
6148_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,let 's start
6149_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> start with the global challenge of urbanization <unk>
6150_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,it 's a fact that people are moving towards <unk> cities and even if counterintuitive <unk> it 's good news <unk>
6151_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,evidence shows that people are better off in cities <unk>
6152_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,the scale <unk> speed and scarcity of means with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon
6153_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> has no precedence in history
6154_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,for you to have an idea out of the three billion people living in cities today one billion are under the line of poverty
6155_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,by two thousand and thirty out of the five billion people that will be living in cities
6156_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,two billion are going to be under the line of poverty
6157_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> that means that we will have to build
6158_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,a one <unk>
6159_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,city per week
6160_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,with ten thousand dollars per family
6161_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,during the next fifteen years a one million person city per week with ten thousand dollars per family if we don 't solve this equation it is not that people
6162_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> will stop coming to cities they will come anyhow <unk>
6163_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,but they will live in slums favelas and informal settlements <unk> so what to do <unk>
6164_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,well an answer may come from favelas and slums themselves
6165_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,a clue could be in this question we were asked ten years ago <unk> we were asked to accommodate one hundred families that had been occupying
6166_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,illegally half a hectare
6167_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,in the center of the city of iquique in the north of chile using a $ ten thousand subsidy with which we had to buy the land
6168_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,provide the infrastructure and build the houses that in the best of the cases would be of around forty square meters
6169_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,<unk> and by the way they said
6170_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,the cost of the land because it 's in the center of the city is three times more than what social housing can normally afford <unk>
6171_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,due to the difficulty of the question we decided to include the families in the process of understanding the constraints <unk>
6172_AlejandroAlvarado_2016X,and we started a participatory design process and testing what was available
6173_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> only way to accommodate all of them was by building in height
6174_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and they threatened us to go on a hunger strike if we even dared to offer this as a solution <unk> because they could not make the tiny apartments expand <unk>
6175_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so the conclusion with the
6176_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> families and this is important not our conclusion with the families was that we had a problem we had to innovate <unk> so what did we do
6177_AlejandroAravena_2014G,well a middle class family
6178_AlejandroAravena_2014G,lives reasonably well in around eighty square meters <unk> but
6179_AlejandroAravena_2014G,when there 's no money what the market does is to reduce the size of the house
6180_AlejandroAravena_2014G,to forty square meters <unk> what we said was what if <unk>
6181_AlejandroAravena_2014G,instead of thinking of forty square meters
6182_AlejandroAravena_2014G,as a small house why don 't we consider it half of a good one when you rephrase the
6183_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> problem as half of a good house instead of a small one <unk> the key question is which half do we do <unk>
6184_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and we thought we had to do with public money the half that families won 't be able to do individually
6185_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> we identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half
6186_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> a house and we went back to the families to do two things join forces and split tasks
6187_AlejandroAravena_2014G,our design was something in between a building and a house
6188_AlejandroAravena_2014G,as a building it could pay for expensive well located land <unk>
6189_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and as a house <unk> it could expand if
6190_AlejandroAravena_2014G,in the process of not being expelled to the periphery while getting a house families kept their network and their jobs
6191_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> we knew that the expansion would begin right away <unk> so we went from this initial social housing
6192_AlejandroAravena_2014G,to a middle class unit achieved by families themselves within a couple of weeks
6193_AlejandroAravena_2014G,this was our first project in iquique ten years ago this is our last project in chile <unk> different designs
6194_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> same principle you provide the frame <unk> and from then on families take over <unk>
6195_AlejandroAravena_2014G,the purpose of design
6196_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> we won 't solve the one million people per week equation unless we use people 's own power for building <unk>
6197_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so with the right design slums and favelas may not be the problem but actually the only possible solution <unk>
6198_AlejandroAravena_2014G,the second case is how design can contribute to sustainability in two thousand and
6199_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> we entered the competition for the angelini innovation center and the aim was to build the right environment for knowledge creation <unk>
6200_AlejandroAravena_2014G,it is accepted that for such an aim knowledge creation interaction among people face to face contact it 's important and we agreed on that
6201_AlejandroAravena_2014G,but for us the question of the right environment was a very literal question we wanted to have a working space with the right light with the right temperature with
6202_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> the right air <unk>
6203_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so we asked ourselves
6204_AlejandroAravena_2014G,does the typical office building help us in that sense <unk> well how does that building look typically <unk>
6205_AlejandroAravena_2014G,it 's a collection of floors one on top of each other with a core in the center with
6206_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> and then a glass skin on the outside
6207_AlejandroAravena_2014G,that due to direct sun radiation <unk> creates a huge greenhouse effect inside <unk>
6208_AlejandroAravena_2014G,in addition to that let 's say a guy working on the seventh floor goes every single day through the third floor but has no idea what the guy on that floor is working on <unk>
6209_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so we thought well <unk> maybe we have
6210_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> to turn this scheme inside out <unk> and what we did was let 's have an open atrium a
6211_AlejandroAravena_2014G,hollowed core <unk> the same collection of floors <unk> but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter <unk>
6212_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so that
6213_AlejandroAravena_2014G,when the sun
6214_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> 's not impacting directly glass but a wall
6215_AlejandroAravena_2014G,when you have an open atrium inside you are able to see what others are doing from within the building and you have a better way to control light <unk>
6216_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and when you place the mass and the walls in the perimeter <unk> then you are preventing direct sun radiation <unk>
6217_AlejandroAravena_2014G,you may also open those windows and get
6218_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> we just made those openings of such a scale that they could work as elevated squares <unk> outdoor spaces throughout the entire height of the building <unk>
6219_AlejandroAravena_2014G,none of this is rocket science <unk> you don 't require sophisticated programming it 's not about technology this is just
6220_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> and by using common sense <unk> we went from one hundred and twenty kilowatts per square meter per year <unk> which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower
6221_AlejandroAravena_2014G,to forty
6222_AlejandroAravena_2014G,kilowatts per square meter per year <unk> so with the right design sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use of common
6223_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> last case i would like to share is how design can provide more comprehensive answers against natural disasters
6224_AlejandroAravena_2014G,you may know that chile in two thousand and ten was hit by an eight point eight richter scale earthquake and tsunami <unk>
6225_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and we were called to work in the reconstruction of the constitucin in the southern part of the
6226_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> we were given one hundred days
6227_AlejandroAravena_2014G,three months to design almost everything from public buildings to public space <unk> street grid transportation housing and mainly
6228_AlejandroAravena_2014G,how to protect the city against future tsunamis <unk>
6229_AlejandroAravena_2014G,this was new in chilean urban design <unk>
6230_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and there were in the air a couple of alternatives first one <unk> forbid installation on ground zero <unk> thirty million dollars spent mainly in land expropriation
6231_AlejandroAravena_2014G,this is exactly what 's being discussed in japan nowadays and if you have a disciplined population like the japanese this may work
6232_AlejandroAravena_2014G,but we know that in chile <unk> this land is going to be occupied illegally anyhow <unk> so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable
6233_AlejandroAravena_2014G,second alternative build a
6234_AlejandroAravena_2014G,big wall heavy infrastructure to resist the energy of the waves
6235_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> this alternative was conveniently lobbied by big building companies because it meant forty two million dollars in contracts and was also politically preferred because it required no land expropriation <unk>
6236_AlejandroAravena_2014G,but japan proved that trying to resist the force of nature is useless <unk>
6237_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> and we started a participatory design process
6238_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> i don 't know if you were able to read the subtitles but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not
6239_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> it is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer <unk>
6240_AlejandroAravena_2014G,it is mainly trying to identify with precision what is the right question there is nothing worse than answering well the wrong question <unk>
6241_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so it was pretty obvious after this process that well <unk>
6242_AlejandroAravena_2014G,we chicken out here and go away because it 's too tense <unk> or we go even further
6243_AlejandroAravena_2014G,in asking what else is bothering you what other problems do you have and you want us to take care of now that the city
6244_AlejandroAravena_2014G,will have to be rethought from scratch <unk>
6245_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and what they said was look <unk> fine to protect the city against future tsunamis we really appreciate but the next one is going to come in what twenty years <unk>
6246_AlejandroAravena_2014G,but every single year <unk> we have problems of flooding due to rain
6247_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> in addition we are in the middle of the forest region of the country <unk> and our public space sucks <unk> it 's poor and it 's scarce
6248_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and the origin of the city our identity is not really connected to the buildings that fell <unk> it is connected to the river <unk> but the river cannot be accessed publicly because its shores are privately owned
6249_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> so we thought that we had to produce a third alternative <unk>
6250_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and our our approach was against geographical threats have geographical answers
6251_AlejandroAravena_2014G,what if <unk> in between the city
6252_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and the sea
6253_AlejandroAravena_2014G,we have a forest
6254_AlejandroAravena_2014G,a forest that doesn 't try to resist the energy of nature <unk> but dissipates it by introducing friction
6255_AlejandroAravena_2014G,a forest that may be able to laminate the water and prevent the flooding
6256_AlejandroAravena_2014G,that may pay the historical debt of public space <unk>
6257_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and that may provide finally
6258_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> access to the river <unk>
6259_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so as a conclusion of the participatory design <unk> the alternative was validated politically and socially but there was still the problem of the cost
6260_AlejandroAravena_2014G,forty eight million dollars <unk> so what we did was a survey in the public investment system <unk> and found out that
6261_AlejandroAravena_2014G,were three ministries with three projects in the exact same place not knowing of the existence of the other projects the sum of them
6262_AlejandroAravena_2014G,million dollars <unk>
6263_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so design 's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities which is not money but coordination
6264_AlejandroAravena_2014G,by doing so we were able to save four million dollars and that is why the forest is today under construction
6265_AlejandroAravena_2014G,be it the force of self construction
6266_AlejandroAravena_2014G,the force of common sense <unk> or the force of nature <unk> all these forces need to be translated into form <unk>
6267_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement
6268_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> life itself
6269_AlejandroAravena_2014G,design 's power of synthesis is just an attempt to put at the innermost core of architecture the force of life
6270_AlejandroAravena_2014G,thank you so much
6271_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> of the world 's population lives in our cities <unk> in developing countries one third of that population is living in
6272_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> of global energy consumption
6273_AlejandroAravena_2014G,occurs in our cities <unk> and eighty percent of gas emissions that cause global warming
6274_AlejandroAravena_2014G,come from our cities <unk>
6275_AlejandroAravena_2014G,so things that you and i might think about as global problems <unk> like climate change the energy crisis or poverty
6276_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> are really in many ways city problems <unk>
6277_AlejandroAravena_2014G,they will not be solved unless people who live in cities <unk> like most of us
6278_AlejandroAravena_2014G,actually start doing a better job because right now <unk> we are not doing a very good one
6279_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and that becomes very clear when we look into three aspects of
6280_AlejandroAravena_2014G,city life
6281_AlejandroAravena_2014G,first our citizens ' willingness to engage with democratic institutions
6282_AlejandroAravena_2014G,second our cities ' ability to really include all of their residents <unk>
6283_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and lastly our own ability to live fulfilling and happy lives
6284_AlejandroAravena_2014G,when it comes to engagement
6285_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> the data is very clear <unk>
6286_AlejandroAravena_2014G,voter turnout around the world peaked in the late ' 80s and it has been declining at a pace that we have never seen before
6287_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and if those numbers are bad at the national level at the level of our cities <unk> they are just dismal
6288_AlejandroAravena_2014G,in the last two years two of the world 's most consolidated
6289_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> nationwide municipal elections <unk>
6290_AlejandroAravena_2014G,in france <unk> voter turnout hit a record low <unk>
6291_AlejandroAravena_2014G,almost forty percent of voters decided not to show up
6292_AlejandroAravena_2014G,in the u s the numbers were even scarier in some american cities <unk> voter turnout was close to five percent
6293_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> in for a second we 're talking about democratic cities in which
6294_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> percent of people decided that it was not important to elect their leaders
6295_AlejandroAravena_2014G,the city of l a a city of four million people elected its mayor with just a bit over two hundred thousand votes
6296_AlejandroAravena_2014G,that was the lowest turnout the city had seen in one hundred years
6297_AlejandroAravena_2014G,right here <unk> in my city of rio <unk>
6298_AlejandroAravena_2014G,in spite of mandatory voting almost thirty percent of the voting population chose to either annul their votes or stay home <unk>
6299_AlejandroAravena_2014G,and pay a fine in the last mayoral elections <unk>
6300_AlejandroAravena_2014G,<unk> you don 't need to look very far in order to find proof of that the city of rio is incredibly unequal
6301_AlejandroAravena_2014G,this is leblon leblon is the city 's richest neighborhood <unk> and this is <unk>
6302_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,this is where over seventy thousand of the city 's poorest residents
6303_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> it sits somewhere in between the hdi of algeria and gabon <unk> so
6304_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> like so many cities across the global south
6305_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,is a place where you can go from northern europe to sub saharan africa in the space of thirty minutes
6306_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,if you drive that is if you take public transit it 's about two hours <unk>
6307_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and lastly <unk> perhaps most importantly
6308_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,cities <unk> with the incredible wealth of relations that they enable could be the ideal places
6309_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> for human happiness to flourish we
6310_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,like being around people we are social animals <unk>
6311_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,instead countries where urbanization has already peaked seem to be the very countries in which cities have stopped making us happy <unk>
6312_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,the united states population has suffered from a general decrease in happiness for the
6313_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> past three decades <unk> and the main reason is this
6314_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,the american way of building cities has caused good quality public spaces to virtually disappear in many many american cities <unk>
6315_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and as a result <unk> they have seen a decline of relations
6316_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,of the things that make us happy many studies show an increase in solitude
6317_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and a decrease in solidarity <unk> honesty and social and civic participation so
6318_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,how do we start building cities that make us care
6319_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,cities that value their most important asset <unk> the incredible diversity
6320_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,of the people who live in them cities that make
6321_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> us happy <unk>
6322_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,well i believe that if we want to change what our cities look like
6323_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,then we really have to change the decision making processes that have given us the results that we have right now <unk>
6324_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,we need a participation revolution <unk> and we need
6325_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> the idea of voting as our only exercise in citizenship does not make sense anymore
6326_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,people are tired of only being treated as empowered individuals every few years when it 's time to delegate that power to someone else
6327_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,if the protests that swept brazil in june two thousand and thirteen have taught us anything
6328_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,'s that every time we try to exercise our power outside of an electoral context <unk>
6329_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,we are beaten up <unk> humiliated or arrested <unk>
6330_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and this needs to change because when it does not only

6336_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> obviously
6337_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,enabling widespread participation and redistributing power can be a logistical nightmare and there 's where technology can play an incredibly helpful role
6338_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,by making it easier for people to organize communicate and make decisions without having to be in the same room at the same time <unk>
6339_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,unfortunately for
6340_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> us when it comes to fostering democratic processes our city governments have not used technology to its full potential <unk>
6341_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,so far most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data
6342_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> fallen trees or broken lamps
6343_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,they have also to a lesser extent <unk> invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them

6345_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,p m but i could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas that 's not participation and in fact governments
6346_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters
6347_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,the way we allocate our budget <unk>

6350_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,that it 's possible for citizens to build their own structures of participation
6351_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,three years ago i cofounded an organization called meu rio

6387_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and because we know that enabling and participating in local politics is a sign that we truly care about our relations to one another <unk> and we are
6388_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> ready to do this in cities around the world right now <unk>
6389_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,with the our cities network the meu rio team hopes to share what we have learned with other people who want to create similar initiatives in their own cities

6398_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> like to tell you a story connecting the notorious privacy incident involving adam and eve and
6399_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,the remarkable shift in the boundaries between
6400_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,public and private which has occurred in the past ten years you know the incident <unk> adam and eve
6401_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,one day in the garden of eden realize they are naked they freak out <unk> and the rest is history <unk>
6402_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,nowadays adam and eve would probably act differently
6403_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> about us is being collected by organizations now
6404_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,there is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information or big data <unk>
6405_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy <unk>
6406_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and my story is about these tradeoffs
6407_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> we start with an observation which in my mind has become clearer and clearer in the past few years that any personal information can become sensitive information <unk>
6408_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,back in the year two thousand about one hundred billion photos were shot worldwide but only a minuscule proportion of them were actually uploaded online in two thousand and ten only on facebook in a single
6409_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> two point five billion photos were uploaded most of them identified <unk>
6410_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,in the same span of time computers ' ability to recognize people in photos improved by three orders of magnitude
6411_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,what happens when you combine these technologies together <unk> increasing availability of facial data <unk> improving facial recognizing ability by computers
6412_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> but also
6413_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,cloud computing which gives anyone in this theater the kind of computational power which a few years ago was only the domain of three letter agencies <unk> and ubiquitous computing
6414_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> which allows my phone which is not a supercomputer to connect to the internet and do there hundreds of thousands of face metrics in a few seconds well
6415_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,to test that we did an experiment on carnegie mellon university campus we asked students who were walking by to participate in a study <unk> and we took a shot with a webcam <unk>
6416_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop while they were filling out the survey we uploaded their shot to a cloud computing cluster <unk> and we started using a facial recognizer to match that shot to a database of some hundreds of thousands of images
6417_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,which we had downloaded from facebook profiles
6418_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,by the time the subject reached the last page on the survey the page had been dynamically updated with the ten best matching photos which the recognizer had found
6419_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and we asked the subjects to indicate whether he or she found themselves in the photo do
6420_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,you see the subject
6421_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,the computer did and in fact did so for one out of three subjects
6422_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,so essentially <unk> we can start from an anonymous face <unk> offline or online <unk> and we can use facial recognition to give a name to that anonymous face thanks to social media data <unk>
6423_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,but a few years back we did something else we started from social media data <unk> we
6424_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> we ended up predicting social security numbers which in the united states are extremely sensitive information <unk> do you see where i 'm going with this
6425_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,so if you combine the two studies together then the question becomes can you start from a face
6426_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,and using facial recognition find a name and publicly available
6427_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> but in fact we even decided to develop an iphone app which uses the phone 's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what i just described to you in real time looking for a match finding public information
6428_AlessandraOrofino_2014G,<unk> to infer sensitive information <unk> and then sending back to the phone so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject
6429_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,an example of augmented reality probably a creepy example of augmented reality in fact <unk>
6430_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,we didn 't develop the app to make it available just as a proof of concept
6431_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,in fact <unk> take these technologies and push
6432_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> to their logical extreme imagine a future in which strangers around you will look at you through their google glasses or one day their contact lenses
6433_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> and use seven or eight data points about you
6434_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,to infer anything else which may be known about you
6435_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,what will this future without secrets look like and should we care
6436_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> we may like to believe that the future with so much wealth of data would be a future with no more biases <unk>
6437_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,but in fact having so much information doesn 't mean that we will make decisions which are more objective in another experiment <unk> we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate
6438_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,we included in this information some references to some funny <unk> absolutely legal but perhaps slightly embarrassing information that the subject had posted online
6439_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> now interestingly among our subjects some had posted comparable information <unk> and some had not
6440_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,which group do you think was more likely to judge harshly
6441_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,our subject paradoxically it was the group who had posted similar information <unk> an example of moral
6442_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> you may be thinking this does not apply to me because i have nothing to hide but in fact privacy is not about having something negative
6443_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,to hide
6444_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,imagine that you are the h r director of a certain organization and you receive rsums
6445_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,and you decide to find more information about the candidates <unk> therefore you google their names
6446_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,and in a certain universe you
6447_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> or in a parallel universe you find
6448_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,this information <unk> do you think that you would be equally likely to call either candidate for an interview
6449_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,if you think so then you are not like the u s employers who are in fact <unk> part of our experiment <unk> meaning we did exactly that we created facebook profiles manipulating traits then we started sending out rsums
6450_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> and we detected <unk> we monitored whether they were searching for our candidates <unk> and whether they were acting on the information they found on social media and they were discrimination was happening through social media for equally skilled candidates <unk>
6451_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,now marketers like us
6452_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor
6453_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> but think again why should that be always the case in a movie which came out a few
6454_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,years ago minority report a famous scene had tom cruise walk in a mall and
6455_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,holographic personalized advertising would appear around him now that movie is set in <unk>
6456_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> about forty years from now and as exciting as that technology looks it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about
6457_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> you and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect
6458_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,so as an example this is another experiment actually we are running not yet completed <unk>
6459_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,imagine that an organization has access to your list of facebook friends <unk> and through some kind of algorithm they can detect
6460_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,the two friends that you like the most and then they create in real time a facial composite of these two friends now
6461_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,prior to ours have shown that people don 't recognize any longer even themselves in facial composites <unk>
6462_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,but they react to those composites in a positive manner <unk> so next time you are looking for a certain product and there is an ad
6463_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,suggesting you to buy it it will not be just a standard spokesperson <unk> it will be one of your
6464_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> and you will not even know that this is happening
6465_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have
6466_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight
6467_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,one of these mechanisms is transparency <unk> telling people what you are going to do with their data and in principle that 's a very good thing it 's necessary
6468_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> but it is not sufficient <unk> transparency
6469_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,can be misdirected you can tell people what you are going to do and then you still nudge them to disclose arbitrary amounts of personal information <unk> so in yet another experiment this one with students
6470_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,we asked them to provide information about their campus behavior including pretty sensitive questions such as this one
6471_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> another group of subjects we told them students and faculty will see your answers transparency
6472_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,notification and sure enough this worked in the sense that the first group of subjects were much more likely to disclose than the second it makes sense right
6473_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,but then we added the misdirection we repeated the experiment with the same two groups this time adding a delay
6474_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,between the time we told subjects how we would use their data
6475_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> the time we actually started answering the questions <unk>
6476_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,how long a delay do you think we had to add in order to nullify the inhibitory effect
6477_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,of knowing that faculty would see your answers <unk> ten minutes
6478_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,five minutes one minute how about fifteen seconds fifteen seconds were sufficient to have the two groups
6479_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> disclose the same amount of information <unk> as if the second group now no longer cares for faculty reading their answers <unk> now i have to admit that this
6480_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,talk so far may sound exceedingly gloomy <unk>
6481_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,but that is not my point in fact i want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives the way we are doing things now is not the only way they can done <unk> and certainly not the best way they can
6482_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,be done when someone tells you
6483_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,people don 't care about privacy consider whether the game has been designed and rigged so that they cannot care about privacy
6484_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,and coming to the realization that these manipulations occur is already halfway through the process of being able to protect yourself <unk>
6485_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,when someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data <unk> consider that in the last
6486_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> twenty years <unk> researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy preserving manner <unk>
6487_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,we can browse the internet anonymously <unk> we can send emails that can only be read by the intended recipient not even the nsa we can have even
6488_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,<unk> big data while protecting privacy of course
6489_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects which is why perhaps you don 't hear more about them
6490_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,which brings me back
6491_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,to the garden of eden there is a second privacy interpretation of the story of the garden of eden which
6492_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,feeling naked and feeling ashamed
6493_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,you can find echoes of this interpretation in john milton 's paradise lost
6494_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,in the garden <unk> adam and eve are materially content they 're happy they are satisfied <unk> however they also lack knowledge
6495_AlessandroAcquisti_2013G,the moment they eat the aptly named fruit of knowledge
