# MLP_Group_Project

When cloning the repo, please leave the structure as is to ensure consistency s.t. the code runs on all machines without issues.

## General Use
- Please use the following naming conventions:

## Code Setup
- The <code>data</code>-folder contains any data. I.e. audio files, text files etc. and does not contain any code
- The <code>src</code>-folder contains all code with subfolders to indicate the purpose (e.g. preprocessing, models, ...)

Please run `python3 setup.py develop` on the root folder to build packages. (Needs more work, currently just recognised src as package)
